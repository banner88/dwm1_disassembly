# SESSION HISTORY — Cold Archive (do NOT read at session start)

> **Purpose.** This file is a verbatim archive of superseded PROJECT_STATE.md
> session blocks and of long narratives compressed out of ROADMAP.md. It exists
> so that consolidation never loses information — but it is **not session
> reading**. Every canonical fact in here already lives in the owning reference
> doc (BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM, MONSTER_DATA, GATE_GENERATION, BREEDING_SYSTEM,
> TEXT_SYSTEM, KEY_LESSONS, …); when this archive and a reference doc disagree,
> the reference doc wins. Use this file only for forensics ("when/why did X
> change") — the session index in PROJECT_STATE.md points here.
>
> **Aging rule (SESSION_PROTOCOL §3):** PROJECT_STATE.md keeps only the latest
> TWO session blocks verbose. When a new session block is written, the oldest
> retained block moves here VERBATIM (prepend to Part 1) and gets one index row
> in PROJECT_STATE. Nothing is ever summarized away — moved, not rewritten.

## Part 1 — Archived session blocks (verbatim, newest first: S59 → S11)

> Session 59 (2026-07-16 — **Phase 0 close-out: the last two Phase 0 boxes.
> Byte-neutral: tools + docs + comments only; ROM MD5 unchanged.**)
> [S61 archival note: the following six lines are the tail of S59's original
> header sentence, orphaned in PROJECT_STATE when S60's 'Last verified' line
> replaced its head; rejoined here verbatim.]
> (tool selftests) + `extracted/skills.json` retired. Byte-neutral session —
> no test ROM. Verifier PASS 5/5** — clean build byte-perfect `1ca6579…`
> (unchanged; the only `disassembly/` edits were comments). Patched-build /
> compiler-regression reference `d31c9300e13b98f516c6bee8b446069d`
> (**patched**) is UNTOUCHED — this session emitted zero ROM bytes; v1
> `79dd32c5…` (patched) and S57 `6c41f0d8…` (patched) remain historical.)
> **NOTE — the ROM was not attached to the kickoff.** It did not need to be:
> the clean build reproduces `1ca6579…` from source, so `data/DWM-original.gbc`
> was reconstructed from `disassembly/game.gbc` and MD5-verified canonical.
> Worth remembering — a missing ROM is not a blocker.
> **(1) `verify_integrity.py` check 5 = tool selftests** (owning doc
> TOOLS_AND_DATA "Guardrail"): `check_tool_selftests()` + `SELFTEST_TOOLS`
> runs `--selftest` on `build_breeding.py` / `build_library_table.py` /
> `build_skill_tables.py`; labels renumbered `/4`→`/5`. **The load-bearing
> design decision is ROM-tolerance:** the ROM is gitignored/user-provided and
> `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs WITHOUT it ("MD5 compare needs only the
> expected hash"), so an absent ROM **SKIPs** check 5 — failing there would
> break every CI push. A present-but-non-canonical ROM still FAILs. All four
> branches proven: PASS 5/5 clean; FAIL on a mutated `skill_records.json`
> `mp_cost` (pinpointed `SkillMPCostTable` offset 0, restored → PASS); SKIP
> with no ROM; FAIL on a 1-byte-corrupted ROM.
> **(2) `extracted/skills.json` RETIRED (deleted).** The box's scope was
> INVERTED (DOC_AUDIT S59): "only `gen_name_tables_db.py` reads it" — that
> tool declared `SKILLS_PATH` and never opened it (dead constant, removed,
> output byte-identical); the three real readers (`gen_skill_table_db.py`,
> `gen_enemy_stats_db.py`, `gen_monster_db.py`) were named in no doc. All
> ported to `skill_records.json`; they use only `id`→`name`, so each port is
> one line. `gen_enemy_stats_db` + `gen_monster_db` outputs byte-identical;
> `gen_skill_table_db` comments-only. `dump_skills.py` → inert tombstone
> (exits non-zero; the `dump_monsters.py` "legacy dumper resurrects a deleted
> file" hazard).
> **ROOT CAUSE (the session's real find; owning section BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM
> "Extent"):** the 34 junk records (ids 222–255 — the docs said 33) came from
> reading the **222**-entry skill function table as **256**. The table is
> `$52:$4011..$41CC` (222 × 2 = 444 B) and is **UNTERMINATED** — its bound is
> simply where the next thing starts: `SkillBlaze` @ `$52:$41CD`
> (`CD FF 5B` = `call $5BFF`). The phantoms were that handler's CODE decoded
> as pointers (`$CD` = `call` opcode ⇒ the bogus `$FFCD`/`$CD5B`/`$E7CD`).
> Corroborated three ways: `$4011 + 222*2 == $41CD == SkillBlaze`;
> `build_skill_tables.py --selftest` re-emits `SkillFunctionTable` at **444
> bytes byte-identical**; ported `gen_skill_table_db` now emits **zero `?`
> fallbacks**, proving `skill_records.json` covers the id space exactly.
> **Doc errors fixed in place (DOC_AUDIT S59):** `bank_052.asm` header
> `$4011..$41BC` → `$41CC` (`$4011+$1BC = $41CD`; the count 222 was right, only
> the end address was wrong — a correct-looking header with one bad number),
> in BOTH `disassembly/` and `patches/`, comment-only, build re-verified
> byte-perfect; same headers' `; Sources: … skills.json` → `skill_records.json`;
> `gen_skill_table_db.py`'s `256 entries`/`512 bytes` → 222/444 and its bogus
> `$4211` xref → `$6CC7` (the only `21 11 40` in bank $52 is `$6CD5`, inside
> `jr_052_6cc7`). The disassembly had been correct at 222 since S45 — the
> TOOLS had rotted past their own source.
> **NEXT:** Phase 0 is now clear, so feature work is unblocked: CF3 (a2)
> (pre-sort save migration) + the two redirected walker helpers (b), or A′1
> (mapID ≥$80 audit). S58's residual test item stands: battle JOIN was never
> explicitly exercised.

> Session 58 (2026-07-13 — **CF3 step 1: party-first sort. The invariant
> "party at slots 0-2 in list order, farm contiguous after" now holds after
> every canonicalize** — the CF1-flagged precondition for farm→SRAM.
> Owning section: MONSTER_DATA "CF3 step 1 as built".)
> **User decisions settled at session start (recorded in ROADMAP CF3):**
> (1) party-first SORT over index remapping; (2) freed-range save semantics
> = **EXPLOIT** (keep the vanilla block copy — the range persists across
> save/load; layout rule: transient scratch stays $DE74, relocated buffers
> take a corner, the bulk is the editor's persistent-state pool, usable
> only AFTER the walker redirects land).
> **Implementation (1 operand edit + 1 new bank entry):** canonicalizer
> tail `ld hl,$0106 / rst $10` at $01:$4808 retargeted **$0106→$7301**
> (2 operand bytes $4809-$480A; pattern `79 EA 8D CA 21 06 01 D7 C9` unique
> in ROM). Bank $73 entry 1 `CF3PartyFirstSort` (patches/bank_073.asm):
> selection sort over ≤3 party-list positions (entry state per vanilla:
> occupied contiguous, list compacted/unique ⇒ t=list[i]>i), 149-B record
> swap i↔t + fixups of every WRAM cell holding raw slot indices across a
> canonicalize — later party-list entries (==i→t), battle-position cache
> $DA15-$DA17 (exchange i↔t; vanilla compaction is provably no-op at the
> mid-battle join canonicalize, the sort is not), $CA40 breeding-offspring
> persist (exchange; vanilla compaction happens to preserve it, the sort
> would not). Deliberately NOT remapped: $CAC0 (vanilla "indices unstable
> across canonicalize" contract; positional uses exist), $DA14 (consumed
> pre-canonicalize, verified). $C0D8 map: no caller consumes it after
> return (20-line scan below all 22 sites). Then nest-calls the displaced
> $0106 (rst $10 stack-nests; depth 3).
> **Validation:** emitted bytes decoded (sm83dis) + byte-executed in a mini
> SM83 interp: identity, scattered party [4,0,2], displaced-member fixup
> [1,0], post-breeding $CA40 tracking, empty party, mid-battle-join shape
> (pre-join cache untouched) — 21/21. Patched-build byte-diff vs S57
> reference: header checksum + 2 operand bytes + bank $73 only. Compiler
> regression re-pinned `79dd32c5…` (patched), 18/18 `--rom` green.
> **Two doc errors fixed in place (DOC_AUDIT S58):** the canonicalizer tail
> $0106 is `ScanPartySlotTable` (+$29/+$31 sanitizer), NOT "follower art"
> (MONSTER_DATA CF1 + bank_001 comment block, both corrected, byte-perfect);
> canonicalizer call-site count re-verified with generator: 22 sites /
> **7** banks ($04 $0A $12 $15 $18 $50 $51), S56's "8 banks" off by one.
> **Semantic delta (user to veto in test):** farm-menu display order can
> change when the party changes (sort displaces farm records that sat
> below a party member) — cosmetic, order-only.
> **NEW OPEN (ROADMAP CF3 (a2)):** pre-sort saves load a vanilla-layout
> roster; the invariant only appears at the first canonicalize after load —
> force a canonicalize/sort on the load path BEFORE any walker redirect
> assumes slots 3-19 == farm. Harmless in the sort-only build.
> **v2 (2026-07-14) — phantom-monster incident + $CA40 fixup removal:**
> user's first v1 session showed phantom farm monsters (garbage species,
> 0 HP/MP, PAIRED junk names "0012/0095", levels 1→cap) — ONLY in the S57
> in-gate save; unreproducible from any clean save on S57 OR S58 builds
> (user ran full gate loops both ways). SHELVED with hypothesis (recorded as
> hypothesis, KEY_LESSONS S58): fossils of the pre-S55 slot-14/16 collision
> bug class in that save's lineage, surfaced by CF2's drain leveling any
> flag-$01 garbage into visibility (level spread = garbage exp; 0 HP =
> level-ups don't heal). User advised to archive the .sav as evidence, then
> release the phantoms in-game. The investigation DID surface a real v1
> defect: the sort's $CA40 exchange-fixup rewrites the farm drop/pick flow's
> live candidate register ($CA40 is dual-role — S56's "breeding persist" was
> one flow's view; farm UI writes it per selection at $0A:~$5CC4 and feeds
> it to unguarded flag-marking paths). REMOVED in v2; $DA15-17 fixup kept
> (verified battle-only, 2 refs). Drain's nested calls exonerated by
> reading: $13 entry 2 + $51:$5B31 are context-free record math off [$CAC0].
> Interp re-run vs v2 bytes 21/21; compiler re-pinned `d31c9300…` (patched)
> 18/18; PASS 4/4. Breeding window + stale-$C0D8 state-machine reads are
> WATCH ITEMS in the as-built section.
> **v2 RESOLUTION (2026-07-14):** phantom mystery SOLVED — user found the
> repro (enter/exit well custom room = +2 Drakslimes "0095", level 0, all
> zeros) and the byte trace confirmed the S55 accepted hazard's undocumented
> facet: room $6B S1 NPC table byte 3 ($03, the spawn Y) is copied to
> wCustomNPCBuffer+3 = $D37C = SLOT 15's IN-USE FLAG (slot 16's = $D411 =
> exit buffer byte 24); the next canonicalize normalizes the spray into a
> real farm record. The <=14 rule protects real monsters, NOT empty 15/16.
> The S57 gate save's 4 fossils = two rooms' visits + CF2 drain leveling.
> SORT EXONERATED (predicted to repro on S57). USER RULING: hazard
> re-accepted, no interim patch, CF3 relocation retires it (ROADMAP CF3 (d);
> hazard note sharpened in patches/wram.asm). v2 then USER-CONFIRMED: farm
> multi pick/drop, breeding (the $CA40 watch item passes), full gate run +
> boss, party shuffles, save/reset. Battle JOIN not explicitly exercised —
> carry as a residual test item.
> **NEXT:** user test of the S58 **v2** ROM (party swaps at the farm —
> multiple picks/drops in one visit, battle join, breeding, save/load,
> farm-menu order sanity) → then CF3 (a2) + the two redirected walker
> helpers (b), or A′1.

> Session 57 (2026-07-13 — **CF2: per-battle exp re-bound to party; farm exp

## Part 2 — Resolved documentation defects (moved from PROJECT_STATE, 2026-07-02)

All items below are RESOLVED; kept verbatim for forensics. Open defects live in
PROJECT_STATE.md "Open defects".

- ~~Two contradictory MD5s across docs~~ → fixed; verifier now polices this.
- README inventory range `$CA21–$CA50` was wrong; **correct: `wInventory` =
  `$CA51`, 20 slots** (ARCHITECTURE.md + patches/wram.asm agree, verified in
  GiveItem handler).
- ~~`extracted/map_table.json` interact/exit labels swapped~~ → fixed;
  `dump_map_table.py` rewritten with verified semantics + $FFFF hole-
  skipping bug also fixed (was dropping a third of rooms).
- NEXT_CLAUDE_MESSAGE.md and SESSION1_ARCHIVE.md are superseded — delete
  (replaced by this file + SESSION_PROTOCOL.md + ROADMAP.md).
- ~~Data layer: tool-behind-data and frozen-source JSONs~~ → ALL RESOLVED.
  `dump_enemy_stats.py` reconciled (full 25-byte decode, 487/487 match);
  new generators written for `skills.json`, `text_id_map.json`,
  `all_scripts.json`; `map_table.json`/`exit_table.json`/
  `room_connections.json` regenerated with fixed decoders; remaining
  JSONs reclassified (hand-authored reference or stable analysis, not
  frozen-source). See TOOLS_AND_DATA.md for the complete audit.
  `monsters.json`, `event_flags.json`, `edits.json` are legacy (deletable).
- KEY_LESSONS.md claims "Bank $0B is safe for insertions" — true for the
  *patched* tree, but this is exactly the loophole that caused the
  byte-perfect drift. Insertions in $0B are allowed **in patches/ only**.
- ~~ROADMAP "NPC show/hide" pointed at opcodes $48/$49 and claimed the
  mechanism was "untraced"~~ → Fixed. The mechanism is the **step
  system** (multiple step entries per screen, counter at $D92A–$D99A
  set by opcode $12). Opcodes $48/$49 are runtime movement-based
  show/hide for cutscenes. Full documentation added to
  ROOM_DATA_FORMAT.md "Room State System", ARCHITECTURE.md RAM map,
  known_RAM_map.md, and CUSTOM_CUTSCENES.md.
- ~~Decompiler opcode names had systematic errors~~ → Fixed. Handler
  code verified against ROM bytes for all critical opcodes. Key fixes:
  $29 was "give_item" (actually AddMonster), $2A was "check_level"
  (actually GiveItem — PROVEN in v23), $41 was "save_map_return"
  (actually SetBGM). Compiler had same errors — "give_item" compiled
  to $29 (AddMonster) instead of $2A (GiveItem). All three tools
  reconciled: decompile_script.py, compile_script.py,
  dump_all_scripts.py. all_scripts.json regenerated.
- ~~Opcodes $00 and $01 names may be swapped~~ → **Confirmed correct
  (no swap).** Verified from assembly: $00 handler does `jp nz, skip`
  after `TestEventFlag`, so it branches when flag is CLEAR =
  "if_flag_clear". $01 handler does `jp z, skip`, so it branches when
  flag is SET = "if_flag_set". `TestEventFlag` returns Z=clear, NZ=set
  via `and [hl]`. Definitively resolved from code; no SameBoy test needed.
- ~~Room $6C step counter addresses $D9A0-$D9A2 collided with event flags~~
  → **Fixed.** $D9A0 = byte 5 of wEventFlags (boss defeat flags $0028-
  $002F: DracoLord, Zoma, Baramos, Pizzaro, Esterk, etc.), $D9A1 = byte 6
  (story flags $0030-$0037 with up to 62 uses each), $D9A2 = byte 7
  (MedalMan, Castle flags $0038-$003F). Writing step counter values there
  would clobber critical game state. Never triggered in practice because
  CustomPtrChase ignored step counters. Fixed by moving all custom step
  counters to $D478-$D47B (verified-unused WRAM gap). Room $6B's $D95E
  (shared with MedalMan original) also moved to $D478.
- ~~Room $6B NPCs blocked exit to Room $6C~~ → **Fixed (v25).** Egg giver
  at (3,3) and BGM changer at (1,4) removed; a prior session had moved
  them into positions that blocked the walkable path to the (3,1) exit
  without updating docs. Item giver at (2,2) retained.
- ~~dump_all_scripts.py decoded linearly, missing ~45% of WriteRAM ops
  at branch targets~~ → Fixed. Work-queue follows 9 branch opcodes.
  810/866 unique WriteRAM ops found (93.5%); 56 in alternate dispatch
  paths remain. $D9E3 story progression counter documented.
- ~~14 separate room-name dictionaries across tools (30–97 entries each,
  all different)~~ → Fixed. Created `dwm/map_names.py` as single source
  of truth (97 entries from editor/editor.py). All 14 tools now import
  from it. Regenerated JSONs use canonical names.
- ~~`analyze_event_flags.py` scanned scripts linearly, missing 70% of
  set_flag operations behind branches~~ → Fixed. Tool now reads
  `all_scripts.json` (branch-following data). Result: 298 flags with
  sets (was 92); check-only anomalies dropped from 219 to 29.
  `event_flags_complete.json` and `EVENT_FLAGS.md` regenerated.
  The 29 remaining are in the 6.5% unreached script paths or engine-set
  (flag $00F1 confirmed in unreached Castle script 0 branch at $0C:$46C4).
  Story progression fully mapped: arena-driven with mandatory Anger/
  Durran gate interludes.
- ~~Bank $04 inline comment at $59D2 labeled opcode $0E as
  "SetMapTransition"~~ → Fixed. $0E is **BranchByScreen** (branches
  if `wScreenIndex == param`). The real map transition is opcode
  **$0F** at $5A02 (MapTransitionFull: writes gate_id → $C96D, flag
  → $C96E, spawn XY, sets wIsPlayerChangingMaps). ROADMAP also
  corrected ($0E → $0F).
- ~~KEY_LESSONS claimed ROM palette pointers had "bit 15 set" as encoding
  marker~~ → **Corrected (Session 9).** Zero step-0 palette pointers have
  bit 15 set (verified all 107 entries). The actual issue: ROM palette bytes
  at `pal_ptr` are in an engine-internal format for ALL rooms, not just some.
  The game engine always transforms them at runtime. Editor tileset PNGs now
  use `room_palettes.json` (runtime-dumped data) via `regenerate_tileset_pngs.py`.

## Part 3 — Archived ROADMAP detail (verbatim narratives from completed items)

Cut from ROADMAP.md on 2026-07-02 (S51 consolidation). Each completed item now
carries a short evidence+pointer stub in ROADMAP; the full original narrative
is preserved here, grouped by item.

### Archived PROJECT_STATE dashboard rows (verbatim, replaced by compressed rows 2026-07-02)

| Add NEW monster species (ids 224–255) | 🟡 working POC (S30): id 224 Gorbunok playable | ROADMAP "Phase N"; mechanics MONSTER_DATA "Species ID geography". N1 scope ✅, N2 info-fork ✅ (`build_new_species.py`→`bank_06a`, `SaveMon_4446` zero-shift, vanilla 0–220 byte-identical), N3 enemy-stats ✅ (16-bit EID → no fork, EID 518 @ `$14:$7EB3`) + wild encounter ✅ (pool 0 slot 3, same-size `EncounterPoolData` edit in `bank_001`), name ✅ ("Gorbunok"), library ✅ (`build_library_table.py --new-species`, unseen-marker `$E0`→`$FE`). All tool-owned/reproducible. **S32 (user-tested):** N5 breeding DONE — Snaily×BattleRex→Gorbunok (special append, `build_breeding.py` admits new-species results), parent-path free via Slime family, recipe icons via `FamilyRecipeResolve`. Hatch crash (bank `$0b` follower overshoot, pinned in SameBoy) fixed (`FollowerArtResolve0b`). Default-nickname+narration "SkyBell" overshoot fixed → "Gorb" first-4 via `LoadModeBaseRedirect` ($00F0 ROM0 padding) → new-species short-name at `$41:$7FF9`. N4 follower ART integrated via `build_new_species_follower.py` (real W.png art, gid `$7e00`, all 8 contexts) — **baked into `patches/` (G1, S34).** **S35 (user-confirmed):** G2 battle sprite DONE — `MonsterBattleGfxTable[224]` `$320f`→`$7e01` (same-size repoint, real slot, no fork), dragon battle pose = 2nd overflow entry `$7e01`, palette reader `label17_41d0` forked to `HighBattlePal` (custom blue palette). **S38 (user-confirmed):** lineage parent-name DONE — line-1 mode-0 wired (`HighModeTable4D`→`HighMode0Ptrs`→`GorbunokRecipeLine` "Snaily   BattleRex", `patches/bank_04d.asm`), so the library/encyclopedia lineage no longer shows "?????". **Open:** `new_species.json` schema fold (G3) — now the only remaining new-species item. |
| Custom rooms (mapID ≥ $6B), multi-screen, exits | ✅ working | patches/bank_060.asm + intercepts. Multi-screen scrolling proven (v28): vertical 2-screen Room $6B (screens 0+4). Room dimensions in $26DD bytes 2-5 control walkable area. **S39: Room $6B can render the gate maze tileset** (gfx-ID `$280D`) with the gate floor palette — sandy island, tree/dune/pit metatiles; `tools/build_gate_room.py` → `bank_064.asm`. (GATE_GENERATION.md §7.2–7.3.) **S40 (Pillar A, user-confirmed in-game): custom-room RENDER is now fully table-driven by `mapID-$6B`** — no hardcoded `cp $6B` render intercepts remain. Two bank-`$17` tables (`CustomRoomPalPtr` = `dw` per room, `CustomRoomAttr` = `db bank,base_entry` per room) drive palette + attr; `CustomGFXMapID` widened `cp $6C`→`cp $70` so each of `$6B-$6F` indexes its **own** `$26DD` tileset/threshold record. Proven by a **second custom room `$6C`**: same gate-island layout/tileset/attr as `$6B`, distinct **moonlit-night palette**, entirely from the tables, zero new render code. System scales to ~140 rooms (`$6B-$FF` minus reserved; `$70+` needs a `$26DD` intercept — Pillar B follow-up). See GATE_GENERATION.md §7.4 + KEY_LESSONS S40. |

| Custom breeding recipes (special table) | ✅ working (same-size edit + capacity extension) | v31/S12: special-recipe override (Anteater×BattleRex→GoldSlime) via two provably-dead entries; in-game confirmed. Tool `patch_breeding_recipe.py`, `patches/bank_016.asm`. Family table is positional (result=slot index). **S13: round-trip encoder B1 built** (`tools/build_breeding.py`, `extracted/breeding_tables.json`) — both vanilla tables decode/re-emit byte-identical. **S13: B2 relocation** (special scan → free bank `$69` via `rst $10`). **S15: B3 capacity 1×–2×** — `build_breeding.py` appends recipes from `extracted/breeding_extra_recipes.json` past index 824 (cap 1650); BattleRex×MadCat→DracoLord confirmed in-game. **S16: B4 family-defaults rewrite** — `build_breeding.py --emit-family` authors the positional family table in place from `extracted/breeding_family_defaults.json`; Bird/Slime/Beast×Dragon + new Dragon×Dragon→GreatDrak confirmed in-game (5 bytes, zero-collateral). **S17: B5 full special-table authoring** — `build_breeding.py --emit-special` owns the WHOLE special table as authored data (825 ROM base + in-place `overrides` by index/parents + `appends`) from `extracted/breeding_special.json`, with a whole-table first-match-wins shadow validator; bank `$16` stays vanilla (single source = JSON → bank `$69`). Confirmed in-game: MadCat×BattleRex→DracoLord (entry-187 in-place edit), Darkdrium×BattleRex→Armorpion (append), S12 GoldSlime preserved. Supersedes the B3 `--emit-relocation` path. **S18: B6 family reassignment** — `build_family_reassign.py` moves monsters between ANY families (incl. ???/Boss=9) via same-size family-byte edits (`patches/bank_003.asm`); reader gate cleared (display/copy only, eligibility is joinability+boss table, not family). **S18: dynamic-library POC** — `build_dynamic_library.py` redirects `SetItem_6242` ($12) to a family-byte scan so the library groups by reassigned family (`patches/bank_012.asm`); user-confirmed, POC only (lags). **S19: B7 production library grouping (DONE, replaces the POC)** — `build_library_table.py` emits a build-time precomputed family→members table into bank `$12` free space + a zero-shift `SetItem_6242` walker; **zero far-loads, zero scratch RAM**, vanilla blank-slot semantics restored; generic-N (`NUM_FAMILIES`) + 256-id-ceiling extension-aware; special entries 215–220 protected; `extracted/library_grouping.json` data deliverable; user-confirmed in SameBoy (zero lag). Production library now done; 11th family (B9) data side unblocked. Rename (B8) folded into B9 per user decision. |

| Custom battle skill EFFECTS (net-new ids) | 🟢 Skill #1 LIVE end-to-end (S49, user-confirmed in SameBoy); system generalizes next (S2e) | **S2 is an ARC, not done.** (1) **Alias framework (S45, POC):** net-new ids ($DE Scorch, $DF Smite) on starter EID 1, templatized to Blaze at the action-queue commit; real id stashed in `$db86`; custom effect via `FarSkillFork` (bank `$72`) → `CustomSkillTable52` (`$52:$7FED`); names via `SkillNamePtrTable`. Single-caster, Blaze-shaped only. (2) **Presentation foundation (S46):** the skill RECORD table (`$54:$4013`→`$41CF`, 222×19B) decoded + round-tripped byte-identical + re-sectioned to `db`; field map FAQ-validated (power/targeting/MP/status/ai_weight); item-effect+meat system (`$52:$4625`, meat→`$58:$591E`); animation dispatch (descriptor-setters `$52:$5460–$54f8` → `$dd6f`/`$dd70` → bank `$4c`/`$55`). Handler=effect TYPE (shared), record=per-skill params. **Full RE + field tables + confidence + known limitations: `BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM.md` (read §⚠️ + §7–§11 before extending).** (3) **Animation renderer (S2c-anim, 2026-06-28, emulator-verified):** the 3 presentation layers (sprite-anim metasprite engine, sound+flash, vertical shake) fully mapped — see §11. (4) **De-aliasing FOUNDATION (S48, byte-neutral):** complete skill-id bucketing map (`$db8a`, 254 reads/9 banks) → the surface reduces to a verified fork set; **keystone = the record-table indexer `$54:$4013` (3 sites `$5251/$5276/$529E`), forking it fixes magnitude/targeting/MP/status/ai_weight + the enemy AI**; HW-confirmed via `$52:$66D9`; the `$535F` divert is a minor path; keystone fork PROVEN byte-neutrally implementable (5-byte `call Fork` trampoline, in-bank tables). Tool `tools/map_skill_id_buckets.py` → `extracted/skill_id_bucket_map.json`; full RE **§12**. (5) **Skill #1 SHIPPED (S2d, S49):** MagicBurn (`$E0`) non-aliased & complete — record+handler+name+announce+animation+flash+SFX, all via clean indirection (announce table `$58:$5806`; custom message pool `$4c:$7326`; `GetPresentId` presentation proxy in `$5f`). The `$5f`-cleanup anim blocker is **resolved**. Full system + how-to-add-a-skill recipe: **`BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM.md` §13**. **OPEN:** S2e custom skill #2 (prove a non-damage/heal shape generalizes); minor follow-ups in §13.4 (custom-id skill-name insert; 2nd bespoke-message render path). |


| System | Blocker |
|--------|---------|
| Random encounters in custom rooms | ✅ PROVEN (Strategy A, Session 11). Mechanism: encounters are gated per-step by a mapID whitelist in `$0B:Jump_00b_4674` (NOT by `wInGateworld`); whitelisting a custom mapID enables them. The battle pool is `GateBasePoolIndex[wGateID]+floor` resolved at battle time, so a non-gate room must pin `wGateID`/`wCurrentFloor` (done in ASM every step) and arm `wEncounterCounter` (room-entry script, since vanilla skips seeding when `wInGateworld=0`). Win+flee return clean; saving still works (no gate mode). **Remaining (editor):** #1 per-room on/off + gate/floor table, #2 custom pools — both specced in CROSSBANK_ROOMS.md, not yet generalized. |
| Custom tile GRAPHICS | Palette attributes fixed (v28). Multi-tileset mashup pipeline working end-to-end (Session 7): editor exports JSON → `build_combined_tileset.py` → ROM patches → playable room with tiles from 4 source tilesets (80 tiles). K-means palette grouping replaced with exact-color matching (10 groups for NORDEN). Game engine forces BG palette color index 1 to shared value ($6BFF) at runtime — build tool swaps EXT palette indices 0↔1 to work around this. Castle VRAM animation at tile indices 77-78 avoided by inserting blanks. Editor has live palette slot counter (X/8) with export validation. **Session 9**: editor tileset PNGs regenerated with runtime-correct palettes via `regenerate_tileset_pngs.py` (all 86 tilesets, using `room_palettes.json`). Force-preview toggle shows colour index 1 marker tint. `--build` flag validated end-to-end (editor export → patched ROM → clean restore). **Session 10**: multi-screen ROM patches working — per-screen layout+attr in bank $64, screen-aware CustomAttrCheck in bank $17, room height in $26DD table. **Remaining**: editor multi-screen UI (screen selector, per-screen canvas, exit/NPC placement); `build_combined_tileset.py` multi-screen export. |
| Custom music | Sound engine unexplored |
| Save-data audit | ✅ Completed Session 8. SRAM save layout fully traced and documented in ARCHITECTURE.md + known_RAM_map.md. Custom flags $0158-$0277 are in save range. Flag byte collisions mapped. Flag $0158 tested in SameBoy: set via NPC script, persisted through save+reload. |



### Archived ROADMAP narratives — Phases 1 / 2B / 2C (cut 2026-07-02)

### Phase1: NPC show/hide

- [x] **NPC show/hide by flag** — mechanism IS the step system
      (ROOM_DATA_FORMAT.md "Room State System"): multiple step entries
      per screen with different NPC lists, step counter set by opcode
      $12 (WriteRAM $D9xx). **Implemented and confirmed in-game (v25)**:
      CustomPtrChase now reads RAM step counter and indexes by ×6
      (was always returning step 0). Room $6C screen 0 has 2 step
      entries — Gatekeeper NPC at step 0 (advances counter via opcode
      $12) replaced by Guard NPC at step 1. Verified: NPC changes on
      re-entry after WriteRAM sets counter. Step counter addresses
      moved from event-flag collision zone ($D9A0-$D9A2 = flags
      $0028-$003F) to safe range $D478-$D47B. Note: $D478+ not in
      SRAM save range — step progress resets on power cycle; for
      persistence, use event flags + room-entry flag checks.
      *Accept*: NPC appears only after custom flag/step is set; verified
      after room re-entry. ✅


### Phase1: monster/egg give

- [x] **Monster/egg give** — opcode $29 (AddMonster) **confirmed working**.
      Takes 1 param (enemy_stats_id). Opcode $28 (CheckStorageFull)
      branches when all 20 slots full. Egg give proven with SkyDragon
      (EID 350, same as Farm event) — egg appears at farm, hatches
      correctly (minor cosmetic glitch on hatch). Direct monster give
      (EID 1) creates a withdrawable monster but species/stats don't
      fully initialize without `$FF04 $000F` preamble. Egg path is
      the practical choice for custom content.
      AddMonsterWrapper needed in bank $04 padding (bare `ret` →
      wrapper + `jp ScriptExecContinue`, same fix as GiveItem $2A).


### Phase1: tile layouts

- [x] **Custom tile LAYOUTS** (compressor done): place compressed layouts
      in a free bank, point step_entry byte 1 at it.
      **Done.** `tools/tile_layout_compiler.py` compiles 20×16 visible
      tile grid → 32×16 padded → LZSS compressed → ASM db statements.
      Bank $64 holds custom layout data with pointer table at $4001.
      Room $6B step entry uses `db 0,$64`. Tileset switching via
      MapIDClampForPalette in ROM0 (currently $04=Farm). User-designed
      layout confirmed in-game. Standalone HTML editor with 170 rooms
      and 85 tilesets delivered (towards_editor/). Spawn position for
      Room $6B is in Exit_GreatTree_s8 (bank_00b.asm), currently (7,6).
      *Accept*: custom room renders a layout that exists nowhere in the
      original ROM. ✅ Confirmed in-game.
      **Known issue (FIXED v28)**: palette attributes were per-position,
      causing color mismatches. Fixed by CustomAttrCheck intercept in
      bank $17 free space ($6C75): for Room $6B, bypasses vanilla attr
      lookup and decompresses custom nibble-packed attr data from bank
      $64 entry 1. Attr data generated by `tools/generate_attr_map.py`
      which builds tile→palette maps from ROM for any of the 85 tilesets.
      Collision threshold table at ROM0 $26E3 uses ×8 stride (not ×1).
      Multi-tileset HTML editor delivered (towards_editor/) with
      walkability overlay, variable-size stamps, marker management,
      tileset names, and full source-mapping export.


### Phase1: tile graphics

- [x] **Custom tile GRAPHICS**: palette attribute intercept DONE (v28).
      Single-tileset rooms fully working (tileset switch + correct palettes).
      **Multi-tileset mashup: WORKING (Session 7, refined Session 8).** Full pipeline:
      editor → JSON export → `build_combined_tileset.py` → ASM patches → ROM.
      **Session 8 critical discoveries and fixes:**
      - **4 palette groups max** (not 8). BG slots 4-7 reserved by game engine
        for monster display (4/5/6) and menu text (7). Verified: all 85 DWM1
        tilesets use max group 3. CustomPalCheck changed B=$08→$04.
      - **Gate detection in banks $06/$07**: mapID≥$50 whitelists treated custom
        rooms as gate-like (blocked saving, wrong menu state). Fixed with
        same-size `ld a,[wMapID]`→`call MapIDClampForPalette` patches.
      - **Ghost NPC**: spawn point script_id=$01 was talkable. Fixed to $00.
      - **Build automation**: `--build OUTPUT.gbc` flag added to
        `build_combined_tileset.py` (patches palette+threshold, builds ROM,
        restores tree). **Validated Session 9** — end-to-end pass with
        3-tileset test export (MedalMan+NORDEN+Farm).
      - **Editor**: PalGrp toggle shows palette group per tile (P0-P3 custom,
        S4-S9 system). Counter shows X/4. Export warns if >4.
      *Accept*: custom room shows tiles cherry-picked from 2+ source tilesets. ✅
      **Session 9 fixes:**
      - Editor tileset PNGs regenerated with runtime-correct palettes from
        `room_palettes.json` via new `regenerate_tileset_pngs.py` tool (86
        tilesets, all verified). ROM step-entry palette data is encoded (not
        raw RGB15) — was causing wrong colours for Starry Shrine and others.
      - Force-preview toggle ("Frc" button) added: swaps between runtime view
        ($6BFF at colour index 1) and marker-tint view (light cyan at index 1).
      - KEY_LESSONS corrected: "bit 15 set" palette claim was wrong — actual
        issue is that ROM palette bytes are always transformed at runtime.


### Phase1: random encounters

- [x] **Random encounters in custom rooms** — ✅ PROVEN (Strategy A,
      Session 11; runtime-verified in SameBoy). The blocker assumption was
      wrong: encounters are NOT gated by `wInGateworld`. They are gated
      per-step by a hardcoded mapID whitelist in `$0B:Jump_00b_4674`
      (`$53`,`$54-$56`,`$57-$59`,`$61-$64`); non-whitelisted normal rooms
      `ret` before the encounter step. **Recipe:** (1) add the custom mapID
      to that whitelist → enables battles; (2) the pool is
      `GateBasePoolIndex[wGateID]+floor` resolved at battle time, so a
      non-gate room must pin `wGateID`/`wCurrentFloor` (done every step in
      ASM — they're read only when a battle fires) and (3) arm
      `wEncounterCounter` from the room-entry script (vanilla skips seeding
      when `wInGateworld=0`). Trigger chain: counter underflow → `rst $10`
      bank $01 entry $0b (`EncounterMonsterSelect`) → `set 6,[wGameState]`.
      *Verified*: Room $6B, gate 0/floor 1 → pool 0 (Slime/Anteater/Dracky);
      `$C935=00 $C939=01 $CA38=00`; win+flee return intact, saving works.
      Full docs: DATA_STRUCTURES "Encounter Runtime Flow", CROSSBANK_ROOMS
      "Random Encounters in Custom Rooms", KEY_LESSONS Session 11.
      **Remaining → moved to Phase 2 (editor):** #1 per-room on/off + gate/floor
      table; #2 fully custom monster pools in a free bank. Both specced in
      CROSSBANK_ROOMS.md.


### Phase2C: gate rotation

- [x] **Custom room into the gate rotation** — TWO halves (BOTH done; Pillar A render S40, Pillar B insertion S41):
   - [x] **Rendering half (S39 + S40 generalisation).** Room `$6B` renders the
         Gate-of-Beginning maze tileset (gfx-ID `$280D`, bank `$28` step `$0D`) with
         the real gate floor palette — sandy island with ocean-wall border, 2×2
         tree/dune/pit metatiles, per-position attr palette. Authored in
         `tools/build_gate_room.py` → `patches/bank_064.asm` (+ `bank_000.asm`
         gfx-ID/threshold, `bank_017.asm` `CustomPaletteColors_6B`, slots 0–3 only).
         **S40 (Pillar A, user-confirmed):** render is now fully **table-driven by
         `mapID-$6B`** — `CustomRoomPalPtr`/`CustomRoomAttr` tables (bank `$17`) +
         per-room `$26DD` records via `CustomGFXMapID` widened to `cp $70`; no
         hardcoded `cp $6B` render code remains. Proven by a 2nd room `$6C` (same
         island, distinct moonlit palette, zero new code). `$6B` byte-identical
         regression verified; verifier PASS. (GATE_GENERATION.md §7.1–7.4.)
         **S42 generalisation:** the old `$6B-$6F` `$26DD`-record ceiling is lifted —
         `$70+` rooms read their record from `Custom26DDTable` (bank `$71`, far-copied
         to `wRoomRecScratch`). See EDITOR_DESIGN.md §2 (keystone, as-built) + Phase 2.
   - [x] **Insertion half (= "Pillar B", S41, user-confirmed in SameBoy).** Custom room
         `$6D` inserted into **gate 1 (Gate of Villager)**, descending floor-to-floor with the
         correct in-gate transition feel. Mechanism chosen was **not** the `rst $00` slot below
         but a cleaner **byte-neutral fork at the gate-branch decision**: the 6-byte gate-0
         exclusion at `$16:$5BA9` (`ld a,[wGateID]/or a/jr z,jr_016_5bbf` — it reads
         **`wGateID $C935`**, the earlier `wCurrentFloor` cite was wrong) is replaced in place
         by `call GateDecisionFork`+3 nops; the fork routes gate 0 → vanilla maze, gate 1 →
         `CustomGate1Setup` (`wMapID=$6D`), all others → untouched RNG gating. Descent uses a
         `gate_flag=$80` exit (mirror of special rooms `$50/$51`). The descent **transition feel**
         (whoosh + continuous BGM, not the hub→gate dissolve + BGM restart) is fixed by a transient
         `wInGateworld=$01` set **only during the transition** (`CustomDescentInGate` @ `$0B`
         `jr_00b_466b`); display-time `wInGateworld` must stay `0` or the room engine's gate/maze
         branches freeze the game. Test ROM `DWM-gate-rotation-v3.gbc`. (GATE_GENERATION.md §7.5.)
         *Alternative/general mechanism still valid for many-room rotations:* point a `rst $00`
         dispatch slot (`$16:$5C32` table, ROM-verified idx0=`$5C42`) at a custom-id handler and
         open its `FloorTypeSelectionTable2` weight. POC forces `$6D` every non-boss floor;
         occasional placement = gate the fork branch behind the RNG roll / a weight table.


### Phase2C: palette derivation

- [x] **Room-palette derivation from ROM (S39).** `tools/derive_room_palette.py`
      reproduces any room's runtime BG palette: colours 0/2 from the room/gate
      palette pointer (`$17:$476F` normal / `$17:$51F5` gate), engine-forced
      idx1=`$6bff`/idx3=`$0000`, screen-scan, clean refusal when unresolvable.
      Validated 30/30 SameBoy dumps + the gate floor. (GATE_GENERATION.md §7.1.)


### B1

- [x] **B1 — Round-trip encoder (keystone).** `tools/build_breeding.py` decodes
      + re-emits BOTH vanilla tables. *Accept:* `$4974`+`$4B30` byte-identical to
      ROM; clean build still `1ca6579…`; verifier PASS. (Decoder half done S12.)
      **DONE (Session 13):** `tools/build_breeding.py --selftest` proves both
      tables round-trip byte-identical to the ROM slices (special $4B30 4126 B
      incl $FF; family $4974 444 B incl $0000), the `db`-text emission re-parses
      to the same bytes, and the disassembly `db` bytes equal the ROM
      (`--check-disasm`). Decode independently reconciles with the hand-authored
      `breeding_complete.json` (825/825 special, 197/197 family slots, 0 diffs).
      Data deliverable: `extracted/breeding_tables.json` (Tier A, `_generator`
      stamped). Verifier PASS 4/4; clean build unchanged. Family encoding
      confirmed positional (result species == slot index; 197 recipes + 24
      separators + 1 terminator = 222 pairs).


### B2

- [x] **B2 — Relocation harness.** Bank `$69` scanner + special table mirrored
      there; bank $16 redirected via `rst $10`; vanilla tables left in place.
      *Accept:* breeding identical to vanilla (regression) in SameBoy; saving OK.
      **DONE (Session 13):** special-table scan ($46F2–$470F, 30 B) replaced
      in-place with `ld hl,$6900` + `rst $10` + 26-byte NOP pad (zero shift);
      faithful port of the scan loop + per-entry check in `patches/bank_069.asm`
      (`db $69`, jump table, scanner, then the table). `rst $10` ABI decoded
      from ROM bytes (H=bank, L=entry<$80; far func ends `ret` → returns to the
      bank-$16 plus-clamp at $4710). Relocated table sourced from the **patched**
      `bank_016.asm` (via `build_breeding.py --emit-relocation`), so it carries
      existing custom recipes. Verifier PASS 4/4; full-ROM diff shows bank $16
      changed only in the 30-byte window. User-confirmed in SameBoy: Anteater×
      BattleRex→GoldSlime (both orders) + vanilla crosses unchanged; saving OK.
      *Note:* rev 1 wrongly sourced the table from vanilla and silently reverted
      the Session-12 recipe (parents fell through to the family table); fixed by
      sourcing from patched bank_016. The `--emit-relocation` self-check now
      asserts relocated == patched table.


### B3

- [x] **B3 — Capacity 1×–2×.** Raise special capacity to ≥1650; add recipes past
      index 824. *Accept:* a recipe at index >824 fires in-game.
      **DONE (Session 15):** the bank `$69` scanner walks to the `$FF` terminator
      with no hardcoded count, so `build_breeding.py` appends recipes from
      `extracted/breeding_extra_recipes.json` after the 825 base entries and
      re-terminates (`SPECIAL_CAPACITY_MAX = 1650`; bank `$69` fits 2× with
      headroom). Proof recipe at index 825: **BattleRex(Pedigree) × MadCat(Mate)
      → DracoLord** — user-confirmed DracoLord in SameBoy (patched ROM
      `f1cd94b1…`; clean build still `1ca6579…`). Picked because it is UNSHADOWED
      by all 825 base entries (the forward order MadCat×BattleRex is the vanilla
      → Yeti recipe at index 187, which would win first — see KEY_LESSONS S15).
      Self-checks: base 825 == patched bank_016 table; S12 recipe intact; appended
      bytes placed + `$FF`-terminated; emit-time SHADOW CHECK fails the build on a
      dead appended recipe. Focused diff: 4 bank-`$69` bytes + checksum.
      *Open follow-up:* fold "base 825 of relocated table == patched bank_016
      table" into `verify_integrity.py` so future table edits can't silently
      diverge (the tool asserts it; the verifier does not yet).


### B4

- [x] **B4 — Family-defaults rewrite.** New family×family map compiled in-place
      (family table `$16:$4974`, same length = zero shift; result = slot index, so
      the compiler inverts `A×B→C` to slot order and rejects positional conflicts;
      preserve the `$FA` wildcard + two-pass search). *Accept:* 8–10 sample crosses
      give NEW results in SameBoy; untouched crosses unchanged. *Note:* family
      table is strictly 1:1 (one cross per result species, no many→one) — put
      flexible/many→one family×family in the SPECIAL table instead (works now).
      **DONE (Session 16, user-confirmed in SameBoy).** `build_breeding.py --emit-family`
      reads `extracted/breeding_family_defaults.json` (positional `result→{p1,p2}`
      overrides), applies them to the vanilla family decode, validates positional 1:1 +
      444-byte zero-shift + shadow classes, and rewrites only the `FamilyRecipeTable` db
      block in `patches/bank_016.asm`. Authored proof set (zero-collateral permutation of
      the three Dragon-mate matchers + one NEW recipe at empty separator slot 37):
      Bird×Dragon→DrakSlime, Slime×Dragon→Almiraj, Beast×Dragon→Wyvern,
      Dragon×Dragon→GreatDrak. **5 changed bytes total** in bank `$16` (focused diff vs the
      B3 ROM = those 5 + 1 checksum byte; the B3 baseline rebuilt as the recorded `f1cd94b1…`).
      User-confirmed: FunkyBird×BattleRex→DrakSlime, Snaily×BattleRex→Almiraj,
      Dragon×Dragon→GreatDrak (patched ROM `caa597d1…`; clean build still `1ca6579…`).
      Beast×Dragon→Wyvern is present but correctly shadowed for MadCat by SPECIAL entry 187
      (MadCat×BattleRex→Yeti) — precedence, not a bug. Untouched BattleRex×Healer→DragonKid
      (vanilla family slot 20) unchanged. Method + precedence: KEY_LESSONS "Session 16".


### B5

- [x] **B5 — Full special-table authoring + overhaul spec.** Extend
      `build_breeding.py` to own the WHOLE special table as authored data (base +
      overrides + appends) and emit it to bank `$69`, leaving bank `$16` fully
      dead; supports edit-in-place of any base entry (e.g. **replace Yeti** =
      change entry 187 result byte) and append. Includes a precedence/shadow
      validator (first-match-wins across the whole table). Author the complete
      `special` + `family_defaults` (incl. Spirit-as-a-breedable-family), build a
      test ROM. *Accept:* user playtest sign-off on the rewritten recipe set.
      **DONE (Session 17, user-confirmed in SameBoy).** `build_breeding.py
      --emit-special` decodes the 825 vanilla entries from the ROM as the base,
      applies `overrides` (edit any entry, by `index` or by parent `match`) and
      `appends` from `extracted/breeding_special.json`, runs a whole-table
      first-match-wins shadow validator (ERRORS on a shadowed append/override;
      WARNS on new collateral shadowing and on a result-species change that other
      entries still produce), and emits only `patches/bank_069.asm`. Bank `$16`'s
      special table stays byte-identical to the ROM (single source = JSON → bank
      `$69`). Self-checks: emitted == authored bytes + `$FF`; untouched base ==
      vanilla; overrides present at their indices; capacity ≤ 1650. Proof
      (confirmed): MadCat×BattleRex → **DracoLord** (in-place edit of entry 187,
      was Yeti), Darkdrium×BattleRex → **Armorpion** (unshadowed append),
      Anteater×BattleRex → GoldSlime both orders (S12 carried forward as overrides
      at dead entries 693/803). Patched ROM `c95f62ce…`; clean build still
      `1ca6579…`. **Supersedes B3's `--emit-relocation` + `breeding_extra_recipes.json`
      as the canonical bank `$69` emitter.** *Note:* the spec carries `base`,
      `overrides`, `appends`; this is the editor's emit backend — the actual recipe
      REWRITE (Spirit-as-breedable, new results across the board) is authored by hand
      in the editor UI later (B5 delivers the machinery, not the content).
      *Folded into `verify_integrity.py`? No — see B3 open follow-up; the tool
      self-asserts, the verifier does not yet run `--emit-special` self-checks.*


### B6

- [~] **B6 — Family reassignment + ??? → "Spirit".** Same-size family-byte edits
      (offset $00 of each 43-byte monster-info entry `$03:$4461`).
      **REASSIGNMENT DONE + reader-gate CLEARED (Session 18, user-confirmed in
      SameBoy).** `tools/build_family_reassign.py` (spec
      `extracted/breeding_family_reassign.json`, validated `from`==vanilla) emits
      `patches/bank_003.asm` as exact-line db edits (zero shift). Monsters move
      between ANY families incl. in/out of ??? (Boss=9). **Reader trace (the gate)
      cleared:** family-byte readers outside breeding are DISPLAY/struct-copy only
      (bank `$01` battle copy, `$04` FamilyTextPtrTable text dispatch, `$07`
      sprite/icon, `$09` VRAM index, `$14` recruit stamp); none gate scout/recruit/
      AI/resistance on family==9 — eligibility is the enemy-stats joinability byte
      (`$14 +$3`) + boss table (`$14:$4897`), independent. Annotated inline at bank
      `$03` `label443f`. **Three family representations found** (BREEDING_SYSTEM
      "B6"): breeding=live byte; status/menus=struct +$0A stamped at creation
      (snapshot — pre-existing monsters keep old value, correct for a fresh hack);
      library=id-range (see below). **Dynamic library PROOF OF CONCEPT done**
      (`patches/bank_012.asm`, `tools/build_dynamic_library.py`): `SetItem_6242`
      redirected to a family-byte scan; all 8 reassigned monsters group correctly
      in SameBoy. POC only (lags ~221 far-loads/render; bearable). *Still TODO,
      split out below:* the ??? → "Spirit" RENAME (the doc's old `FamilyTextPtrTable`
      entry-9 claim was WRONG — that's a per-family monster-text dispatch, not the
      family-name string; find the real string first); the production library table;
      the 11th-family feature.


### B7

- [x] **B7 — Production library grouping table (replaces the B6 POC).**
      **DONE (Session 19, user-confirmed in SameBoy — zero lag, reassigned monsters
      under correct tabs).** `tools/build_library_table.py` emits a precomputed
      **family→members** table into bank `$12` trailing free space (`$7B9B+`) at build
      time and rewrites `SetItem_6242` zero-shift (`jp LibScanByFamily`, 82-byte body →
      `jp` + 79 `nop`). The walker reads the table directly — **zero far-loads, zero
      scratch RAM** (the POC's two costs eliminated), and restores vanilla blank-slot
      semantics ($E0 for unseen / id for seen) the POC had dropped. Table format is a
      pointer table + length-prefixed member lists (additive for an 11th family);
      family assignment sourced from the vanilla family byte + `breeding_family_reassign.json`
      (the SAME spec `bank_003`/B6 consumes, kept in lock-step). Build-time validation:
      `--selftest` proves no-reassign grouping reproduces the vanilla bounds table
      exactly (parity); every family ≤ buffer capacity (32); free-space fit; ids ≤ 255.
      Data deliverable `extracted/library_grouping.json`. **Extension-aware (no hardcoded
      221):** species ids are 1 byte (256-ceiling); `COLLECTIBLE_MAX` (→255) and
      `NUM_FAMILIES` (→11, B9) are the only knobs — table + walker are already count/id
      agnostic. The 6 special non-collectible entries (215–220: TERRY? story enemy +
      4 summon tiers + 1 blank) are enumerated and PROTECTED (excluded, never a
      reassignment target). Test ROM `065943f6…`; clean build still `1ca6579…`. Method:
      KEY_LESSONS "Session 19 — Breeding B7"; format: BREEDING_SYSTEM "Dynamic library
      → PRODUCTION (B7, done)". *Open follow-up:* tool not yet folded into
      `verify_integrity.py` (self-asserts via `--selftest`; the verifier does not run it).


### B8

- [~] **B8 — ??? → "Spirit" rename (10 families, no insert).** **PREREQ SOLVED
      (S20):** the "family name" is an ICON font tile, not a string — there is no name
      string to edit (`FamilyTextPtrTable` confirmed a red herring). 10 icons at
      `$4F:$4110-$41A0`, text bytes `$10-$19`, addr = `$4010 + byte*16`; detail line is
      `<$F0><icon>"family"` (bank `$4D`), tab strip blits the same tiles. So a
      rename-only is "swap the `$19` (???) icon tile." **NOT the chosen route** — per
      the S19/S20 user decision Spirit is ADDED (B9), not a 10-family replace; this row
      stays as the solved-trace record. *Accept (if ever taken):* the ??? tab shows the
      new icon; clean build still `1ca6579…`.


### B9

- [~] **B9 — Add an 11th family (keep ??? AND add Spirit).** **VRAM CORRUPTION FIXED +
      ICON SHIPPED (2026-06-19, user-confirmed in SameBoy; built ON TOP of the gate fix).**
      The family-10 catch→map VRAM wipe is fixed (`ClampFamIdx` in ROM0 clamps the
      10-entry family-indexed GFX table `01:$4BAD` so family 10 can't read OOB; the
      species-indexed `$499D`/`$49DF` follower lookup is left alone). The Spirit whip
      (option 5) ships on font byte **$19 (`$4F:$41A0`)**, overwriting vanilla ??? — NOT
      the free $1A slot, which the menu blanks at runtime. Followers, library grouping,
      and family attribution confirmed correct; clean build `1ca6579…`; integrity PASS.
      See KEY_LESSONS "Spirit B9 Lessons" + PROJECT_STATE (2026-06-19 block). *Remaining
      polish (not blocking play):* the "$1A vs $19" line in the S20 notes below is stale;
      tab-strip/nav-grid layout for an 11th visible tab is the only open UI nicety.
      ~~**ICON HALF DONE (S20,~~
      pending SameBoy sign-off).** The family-icon path is traced (see B8) and the 11th
      icon's free slot is found: **byte `$1A` → `$4F:$41B0`** (blank filler; charmap
      "20-23 are blank"). `patches/bank_04f.asm` inserts the user's "Fire Whip Spirit"
      art there as a same-size 16-byte 2bpp tile (zero shift; bank `$4F` otherwise
      byte-identical to vanilla). Tool `tools/build_family_icon.py` + data
      `extracted/family_icons.json` (Variants A/B: head on palette index 0 for a yellow
      head if the menu palette allows, else index 2). Verifier PASS 4/4 (bank_04f added
      to patch set). Test ROM `ab59c842…`; clean build still `1ca6579…`. **STILL OPEN
      (rest of B9, next session):** (1) confirm the "yellow head" palette in SameBoy
      (menu BG pal via `LoadGBCPalettes`→`rst $10` `$17:$03`); (2) wire Spirit as
      family 11 — the `$4D` detail line (`$F0 $1A "family"`), the tab-strip 11th cell
      (`LoadItem_4241` `b=5,c=10` grid + tab graphics), the family-code (`$FA` wildcard
      question), `NUM_FAMILIES`→11 in `build_library_table.py`, family reshuffle. Icon
      is not yet referenced by any family, so view it via SameBoy's VRAM viewer until
      wired. Scope (full): BREEDING_SYSTEM "Family icons (B8/B9)" + "Future — 11th family".
      *Decision (user, S19/S20):* Spirit is ADDED as the 11th family, then families
      reshuffled.


### BUG breeding cutscene

- [x] **BUG — breeding cutscene: parent sprites glitch.** **FIXED Session 14.**
      Observed Session 13 while playtesting B2; confirmed **not caused by B2**. Root
      cause was an incomplete bank `$0B` labelization: three raw pointer refs into the
      bank's shift region (`$4974` sprite-pointer table; `$42c8`/`$4308` gate table)
      were never converted to labels, so the custom dispatch's shift left them stale —
      and in `patches/bank_00b.asm` the sprite ref was additionally **mislabeled** to
      `RoomScreenPtrTable` (`$49b5`) instead of the real `$4974` data (`$4911`).
      Fixed by re-sectioning both tables into labeled `dw`/`db` (disassembly stays
      byte-identical to `1ca657…`) and repointing the sprite consumer. User-confirmed
      in SameBoy (clean build still `1ca657…`; patched ROM `b43a04fe…`). See
      KEY_LESSONS "Session 12 Lessons — Bank $0B repointing" and PROJECT_STATE.



### Archived ROADMAP narratives — Phases D / F / N (cut 2026-07-02)

### PhaseD: seams

- [x] **Annotate the new-species fork SEAMS in clean disassembly (labels/comments
      only, byte-perfect `1ca6579…`).** The "which site is the seam" knowledge currently
      lives only in patches + MONSTER_DATA. Propagate it as comments at the clean anchors:
      `bank_003 label443f`/`SaveMon_4446` (single info indexer; id≥224 fork point),
      `bank_014 LoadEnemyStats` + the `$7EAD` trailing free run (16-bit EID → append, no
      fork), `bank_001 EncounterPool_000` (slot = EID(+10,×2)/weight(+20); empty slot =
      insertion point), and the **8 follower gfx-ID copies** (`$01 $06 $07 $09 $0b $12 $18
      $59` — the mgbdis defaults `FieldPtrLookupTable`/`TextDataPtrLookup`/`TileRefLookupTable`
      etc. don't reveal they're copies; rename/annotate so a swap knows to repoint all 8).
      CAUTION: a mislabel that resolves to the wrong address passes review but glitches at
      runtime (SESSION_PROTOCOL §4) — verify the build stays `1ca6579…` after each label.
      *(Flagged S30, deferred from the two-defect-fix session — own scoped pass. PARTIAL: the
      follower render seams `bank_011 HramUnk11_406e` (attr read + overshoot) and `bank_001
      GetActiveMonsterStatus` (overworld walk loader + clamp) annotated when N4 was finished —
      build still `1ca6579…`.*
      ***S33 — the name/text/lineage/follower DISPLAY seams DONE*** (labels/comments only,
      build `1ca6579…`, integrity 4/4, all referenced labels sym-verified to their addresses):
      bank `$41` `$4007` mode→table config list (modes 5/7/8/11 documented) + the corrective
      `FamilyCodePtrTable` block (species-indexed 2-letter default-nick, NOT family; legacy
      labels) + `Func_Bank41_GetText/GetPutText`; ROM0 `SaveBankAndSwitch $092F`/`TextHandler_0940
      $0940` two-level `[mode][id]` lookup + overshoot hazard + `LoadModeBaseRedirect $00F0` fork
      cross-ref; bank `$12` `LoadItem_6456`/`LoadItem_65a8`/`CmpItem_65cb` lineage chain; and the
      **8 follower gfx-ID copies** at their add-base sites (`$01:$49a7`→`ScreenTransDataTable`,
      `$06:$4d7e`→`MapNPCPosDataTable`, `$07:$66b8`→`TileRefLookupTable`, `$09:$61fb`→
      `FieldPtrLookupTable`, `$0b:$490f`→`SpritePtrTable_4974`, `$12:$65de`→`ItemSlotPtrTable`
      [= the lineage parent-icon table, doubles as the menu copy], `$18:$40bf`→`TextDataPtrLookup`,
      `$59:$42ca`→`SaveSlotPtrTable`); + one optional cross-ref at bank `$16` `$0301` parent-family
      load. CORRECTIONS recorded in source + MONSTER_DATA: **ItemNamePtrTable = mode 8** (not 11);
      **`$4739` overshoots at id≥215, fork covers id≥224**.
      ***S38 — the DATA-TABLE seams DONE*** (labels/comments only, build `1ca6579…`, integrity
      4/4; new label `EnemyStatsTrailingFree` sym-verified to `14:7ead`, cross-ref patch labels
      `FamilyRecipeResolve`/`NewSpeciesInfoCopy` confirmed to exist): `bank_003 label443f`/
      `SaveMon_4446` (single info indexer; patched `cp $e0` → bank `$6A` fork; also reached as
      `$03` entry 1 by breeding's `$0301` parent-family load); `bank_014 LoadEnemyStats` (16-bit
      EID → NO fork) + new label `EnemyStatsTrailingFree` @ `$7EAD` (append region — records that
      the 487-entry table ends at `$7BAC` but `$7BAC..$7EAC` is CODE, so EIDs 487–517 are unusable
      and the first grid-aligned slot is EID 518 `$7EB3`); `bank_001 EncounterPool_000` (empty
      slot = EID 0/wt 0 = in-place insertion point, Iron-Rule-2 safe); `bank_016 label16_485c`
      (entry-1 recipe lookup overshoots the 222-entry `FamilyRecipeTable` → `FamilyRecipeResolve`
      DISPLAY fork) + the two `$0301` parent→family conversion sites (new species resolves a real
      family as a breeding PARENT via the forked info loader). **STILL PENDING (own pass, NOT a
      new-species seam — general breeding mechanics): bank `$16` breeding-determination internals
      proper (`LoadBrd_4653` plus/special, `LoadBrd_45d5/45ff` family scan, special→family→pedigree
      precedence) — deferred to a breeding-mechanics annotation pass.**


### PhaseD: resection

- [~] **Re-section misassembled data tables → labeled `db`/`dw`.** mgbdis decoded
      many in-bank DATA tables as fake instructions (`rst $38`, `db $fc`,
      `ld hl,sp+$nn`, stray `stop`, etc. appearing mid-routine). These pass the build
      (bytes are identical) but READ as garbage code, so a future session can't edit
      the table in source and wastes time re-deriving it from raw bytes — it bit S18
      (the library bounds table) and earlier ($0B sprite/gate tables, fixed S14).
      Convert each to a labeled `db`/`dw` block; **the build MUST stay `1ca6579…`**
      after each (a wrong split changes bytes → fails instantly — same guard as the
      S14 labelization rule, KEY_LESSONS). Drive this by what the editor must EDIT,
      not completionism. *Accept:* targeted tables read as `db`/`dw` with names; MD5
      unchanged; the editor can address them by label.
      **DONE (Session 26 + Session 27): bank `$12` library/family data — COMPLETE.**
      `tools/resection_library_tables.py` converted `LibraryFamilyTabBounds` (`$6294`,
      the S18 case), the two tab-column cursor-position tables (`$564a`/`$5a8e`), and
      the **entire contiguous window-draw layout run `$710c..$7b9b` (29 layouts)**.
      Session 26 did the directly-referenced subset (`$710c/$71aa/$71f4`/`$759a`/`$7b42`/`$7b6c`);
      **Session 27 finished the two remaining contiguous gaps** (`$724e..$759a` = 10
      layouts, `$75c0..$7b42` = 13 layouts), including the 380-B `$79c6` full-screen
      view whose fake `jr` labels (`$7a05`…`$7aca`) vanished cleanly with their
      in-range `jr` sources. 44 raw-pointer reference sites labelized in total; the 21
      `ld hl,$XXXX; rst $10` far-call descriptors (`$5605`/`$6100`/`$6101`) correctly
      LEFT raw. Clean build still `1ca6579…`, integrity PASS 4/4. All 29 layouts also
      decoded to `extracted/library_layouts.json` (`--dump-json`). Format + addresses
      in DATA_STRUCTURES "Library / family-tab menu data (bank `$12`)". The tool uses a
      zero-byte probe-build to map source line → address (no opcode-size summing — the
      S22 trap), is per-table idempotent, and is re-runnable from the clean tree
      (verified: clean-tree run reproduces the byte-perfect build + identical 29-label set).
      **NEXT (per-session, one each):**
      (1) ✅ **Finish bank `$12`** — DONE (Session 27, above). The whole `$710c..$7b9b`
          run now reads as labeled `db`/`dw`; `$79c6` converted; far-call descriptors left.
      (2) **Tick the STALE BOXES below** — bank `$03`/`$14`/`$16` look already
          `db`-converted (`$14`/`$16` clean; `$03` has 23 `rst $38` runs to confirm as
          padding vs data). Cheap verify-and-check-off.
      (3) **Editor-driven only:** bank `$01` encounter pools → `db` (Encounters #2 needs
          to edit pools), bank `$51` transitions, bank `$50` event state machine — do
          these when the feature is built, not for completionism.
      (4) **Checked, SKIP (no editor value, mis-split risk):** the `$ff`-padding banks
          `$08/$15/$2c/$33/$55/$66` from the old seed list — verified mostly filler
          (`$08`: 2061, `$55`: 2112 `rst $38`). Not discrete tables.


### GFX-1

- [x] **GFX-1 — Graphics system: gfx-ID indirection + sprite decompressor → annotate + tool.** ✅ DONE (Session 22)
  *DONE Session 22 — see PROJECT_STATE "Session 22" + KEY_LESSONS "Session 22" +
  MONSTER_DATA "Monster sprite graphics system". Delivered: (a) battle gfx-ID table
  `$00:$2B9F` re-sectioned to `MonsterBattleGfxTable` (`tools/resection_battle_gfx_table.py`,
  build still `1ca6579…`, 23 cross-refs preserved); (b) `dwm/sprite_codec.py` — shared
  LZ codec, decode byte-exact, `decode(encode(x))==x` on all 442 streams; (c)
  `tools/extract_monster_sprites.py` + `extracted/monster_sprites.json` (all 221,
  count-parameterised); (d) `tools/build_sprite_swap.py` generalised species-agnostic.
  ACCEPT criterion adjusted: round-trip is SEMANTIC (`decode(encode)==x`), NOT vanilla
  byte-identical re-encode (no editor value — documented). Dracky→Anteater swap
  user-confirmed in SameBoy. Doc errors below FIXED in the re-section comments.
  REMAINING (moved to editor-backend / GFX-3): cross-bank free-space allocator (swap
  tool knows bank `$36` only); follower-sprite extraction + animation-frame layout.*
  *Original verified facts (kept for reference):*
  - **gfx-ID = `(bank<<8)|index`.** High byte = ROM bank, low byte = index.
  - **Resolver `DecompressTileLayout` @ `$00:$1627`:** switches to `bank` (`ld[$2100],a`
    low bits; `swap a/rra/and 3 → ld[$4100],a` high bits — also twiddles SRAM bank,
    restored after, harmless). Reads per-bank pointer table at **`$<bank>:$4001 + index*2`**
    → stream addr in `$4000–$7FFF`.
  - **Stream header (3 bytes):** `[declen_lo, declen_hi, runmark]`, then LZ body.
    Decompressor path `WaitDMATransfer $00:$1577` → `TextScrollWindow` → writes to VRAM dest HL.
  - **LZ body:** byte≠runmark → literal; byte==runmark → back-ref: next 2 bytes `b0,b1`,
    offset = `b0 | ((b1>>4)&0xF)<<8` (**ABSOLUTE** index into output base `$ac/$ad` = VRAM dest),
    count = `(b1&0xF)+4`, extension if low-nibble=`$F` (count = next_byte + `$13`).
  - **KEY ARCHITECTURE:** back-refs point into a **SHARED VRAM tile pool pre-loaded before
    the per-monster stream**, so one monster stream does NOT decode standalone (Dracky's
    battle stream is ~9 on-disk bytes → 576 decompressed). **POC lever:** a stream with NO
    runmark byte in its body = pure literal copy = self-contained (ignores the shared pool).
    `tools/build_sprite_swap.py` (added this session) uses exactly this to repoint Dracky.
    *(Gotcha: fill the WHOLE tile field with the backdrop index, not just the sprite
    footprint — else the surround renders as palette index 0. For Dracky's battle palette
    that index 0 is red; backdrop is index 1. Fixed in the tool via `BG_INDEX`/`BODY_INDICES`.)*
  - **Battle path (VERIFIED):** `SetFld_466d` (bank `$07`, ~line 1008) reads species (`$caca`),
    indexes table at **`$00:$2B9F`** by `species*2`, DMAs to VRAM **`$8B00`**. Dracky (sp 78)
    → gfx-ID **`$3627`** (bank `$36` idx `$27`; 576 B / 36 tiles / 48×48; runmark `$02`).
    Word lives at ROM0 `$2C3B` = `27 36`.
  - **Follower path (VERIFIED):** table `ScreenTransDataTable` @ `$01:$49DF`, loader
    `GetActiveMonsterStatus` @ `$01:$4986`, index `(species+$10)*2`; plus a family-shared
    2nd load via `$01:$4BAD`. Dracky follower = gfx-ID **`$383E`** (bank `$38` idx `$3E`; 256 B / 16 tiles).
  - **DOC ERRORS to fix while annotating:** `bank_038.asm` header says "gate dungeon tileset J"
    but it ALSO holds monster follower sprites; `bank_036.asm` pointer table is labeled
    "Cross-bank dispatch table (40 entries)" but is actually the **gfx pointer table**.
  - **DISCARD (bogus):** an earlier `$382E` battle guess came from scan-tables at
    `$07:$6E14`/`$09:$6B10` that have **NO code references**; `$382E` is a dungeon tile, not Dracky.
  - **Deliverables:** labels/comments on the resolver, decompressor, pointer tables, and both
    species→gfx-ID tables; fold a proper decode/encode into the tool; extract the gfx-ID
    tables to JSON (tool ships with data). **Accept:** clean build still `1ca6579…`; tool
    round-trips a sprite byte-identically; Dracky→clam swap reproducible.



### GFX-2

- [x] **GFX-2 — Monster palette system + recolour + cross-bank sprite backbone.** ✅ DONE (Session 23)
  *DONE Session 23 — see PROJECT_STATE "Session 23" + KEY_LESSONS "Session 23" +
  MONSTER_DATA "Monster battle palette system". Delivered: (a) `dwm/sprite_bank.py` —
  cross-bank overflow allocator (places streams in reserved `$7E–$7F`/`$7C/$7A/$79`
  with a `$4001` pointer table; resolver reads `$<bank>:$4001+index*2` with no bank
  gating, so ANY of 221 monsters repointable regardless of source bank); (b)
  `tools/build_sprite_swap.py` rewritten — cross-bank, `--relocate` (lossless proof) /
  `--png` / `--payload`, `--palette` recolour, `--build-rom` focused test ROM; (c) the
  monster battle palette SOLVED — per-species table `MonsterBattlePalettes @ $17:$62FD`
  (was mislabeled `RoomAttrDataBlocks`), 8 B/species, loaded by entry 6 (`$1706`); found
  via SameBoy BG-slot-4 dump + ROM grep; annotated in `bank_017.asm` (byte-perfect);
  (d) `tools/extract_monster_palettes.py` + `extracted/monster_palettes.json`;
  `extracted/monster_sprites.json` regenerated (all 221, was a 3-monster subset).
  Proofs (user-confirmed in SameBoy): Slime relocated cross-bank renders identically;
  DWM2 clam→Dracky battle + correct purple palette; and the full combined ROM (clam +
  Dracky→Spirit family + custom room with random encounters + breeding/library) clean.
  REMAINING (GFX-3): follower path needs `$01:$49DF` re-section + its own palette table
  (find the same way) + the family-shared `$4bad` block.*
  *Original verified facts (kept for reference):*
  - **Why needed:** the clam swap renders correctly but in Dracky's palette {red, white,
    gold/brown, black} — no purple available from tiles alone. Recolour = editing palette data.
  - **VERIFIED (probe ROM this session):** Dracky's battle palette indices are
    **0=red, 1=white/transparent (backdrop), 2=gold/brown, 3=black** (index 1 is the backdrop).
  - **Traced (speculative chain):** CGB upload routines live in **bank `$17`** (`rBCPS/rBCPD/rOCPS/rOCPD`
    writes); bank `$00` has buffers `wBGPalette/wObj1Palette/wObj2Palette` + loaders
    `SetGBCPalette`/`SetPaletteGBC`/`LoadGBCPalettes`. `SetGBCPalette(a=palID)` →(GBC)→
    `SetPaletteGBC` stores ID at `$c850`, then `ld hl,$1704; rst $10` (far-call into bank `$17`)
    does the upload from a palette table. **The per-monster/family palette SELECTION point is
    NOT yet pinned** — the battle display init (bank `$07` ~lines 1090–1180) reads family
    (`$cacb`) + species and calls `FuncFld_6942` etc.; start tracing there. NOTE the
    `SetGBCPalette` calls in bank `$07` at lines 2460/2609 are SCENE palettes (warp/gate id `$03`),
    **not** the monster's — don't be misled.
  - **NEW LEAD (Session 22, user SameBoy VRAM data):** the enemy monster's tiles use ONE
    **shared OBJ palette slot — slot 4** (confirmed: Dracky AND a blue slime both show OBJ
    attribute `04` in the VRAM viewer). So the SLOT is fixed; the per-species COLOURS are written
    into slot 4 at battle-init. This means recolour = edit the **per-species colour data loaded
    into slot 4**, NOT a slot/palette-ID assignment. Concrete entry point: `FuncFld_6942` (bank
    `$07` ~line 6567) and `SetGBCPalette` — note `FuncFld_6942` does `ld h,$04` (matches slot 4).
    Trace from there to the colour table that feeds the `$1704`/`rst $10` upload.
  - **Recolour approach (speculative):** find the palette DATA table in bank `$17` reached via the
    `rst $10`/`$1704` path, indexed by the monster/family palette ID; edit the 4 RGB555 colours,
    OR repoint selection to a custom palette. **First confirm scope** (per-family vs per-monster):
    a family palette edit recolours Dracky's whole family. **Accept:** clam renders in corrected
    (e.g. purple) colours in SameBoy.



### GFX-3

- [x] **GFX-3 — Walking/follower sprite swap.** ✅ DONE (Session 24)
  *DONE Session 24 — see PROJECT_STATE "Session 24" + MONSTER_DATA "Follower /
  walking-sprite system" + KEY_LESSONS "Session 24" + TOOLS_AND_DATA. User-confirmed in
  SameBoy: blue dragon → DarkDrium follower, all 4 directions perfect.*
  **Delivered:**
  - **Re-section:** `ScreenTransDataTable` @ `$01:$49DF` → labeled `dw` block
    (`tools/resection_follower_gfx_table.py`; 231 entries `species+$10` + `FollowerFamilyGfxTable`
    @ `$4BAD`; build still `1ca6579…`). `build_sprite_swap.py --kind follower --payload F.bin`
    repoints + DMAs a 16-tile (256 B) self-contained literal stream.
  - **Render engine reverse-engineered:** `SaveScr_40cd` @ `$04:$40cd` (GBC variant of ROM0
    `$0d91`). Metasprite list of 4-byte **(dy, dx, tile_offset, attr)** entries, `$80`-term;
    OAM tile = `tile_offset + [$ffc9]` (follower base `$20/$30/$40` per party slot); OAM attr
    = `[$ffca] XOR attr` (X-flip bit5). 2-level table, sprite-type `$ffc7`(=`[$ca91]`) →
    frame/dir `$ffc8`. Head-mirror = two entries sharing a tile_offset, one X-flipped.
  - **OBJ transparency:** idx0 = HARDWARE-transparent for OBJ (battle BG used idx1 — opposite).
    8 OBJ palettes @ `$17:$5615`.
  - **118-layout library** (`tools/extract_follower_layouts.py` → `extracted/follower_layouts.json`):
    76 non-sharing (disjoint down/up/side → any distinct art renders clean; 202 types) + 42
    sharing (blob-only; 58 types). **Layout is per-monster, not universal** — this is why a
    symmetric blob (clam/Healer) hides layout errors and a directional dragon exposes them.
  - **Tooling:** `tools/follower_frame_picker.html` (drag 6 boxes, engine-accurate preview,
    export coords/payload) + numbered-tile calibration ROM method (each VRAM tile shows its hex
    index + flip-foot; `--palette` override = black digit / red foot for terrain legibility).
  *Original plan (for reference):*
  GFX-3 — Walking/follower sprite swap. Rides the Session-23 cross-bank backbone
  (`dwm/sprite_bank.py` + `build_sprite_swap.py`), but via the FOLLOWER path. Prereqs now
  known: (1) **re-section `ScreenTransDataTable` @ `$01:$49DF`** from mgbdis fake
  instructions to a labeled `dw` block (byte-perfect, same job as the S22 battle gfx
  table — preserve any cross-bank referenced labels), then `build_sprite_swap.py --kind
  follower` can repoint it (the tool already has the follower table wired, gated until the
  re-section lands); (2) the follower likely has its OWN palette table — find it the same
  way GFX-2 found the battle one (SameBoy dump of the follower's palette slot + ROM grep);
  (3) handle the **family-shared `$4bad` second DMA** (the B9-clamped 10-entry family GFX
  table) — verify in SameBoy whether it overlaps the swapped walk frames. Follower = 16
  tiles (`$383E` for Dracky); the 16-tile stream holds the full walk-animation frame set.



### GFX-4

- [x] **GFX-4 — Monster → follower-layout auto-map (completes GFX-3 automation).** ✅ DONE (Session 25)
  *DONE Session 25 — see PROJECT_STATE "Session 25" + MONSTER_DATA "Monster → layout dispatch" +
  KEY_LESSONS "Session 25" + TOOLS_AND_DATA. User-confirmed in SameBoy: Healer→Dragon clone and
  Dracky→custom blue-dragon (imported art), correct all directions, consistent across overworld +
  menu + library.*
  **Delivered:**
  - Level-1 layout tables LOCATED at fixed `$10:$407f` (species 0–127) / `$11:$407f` (species 128+),
    indexed by species; per-species attr/palette table at `$10:$417f` / `$11:$412d` (bit6=Y-flip, bit5=X-flip, low3=OBJ palette). (`[$caca]` is the SPECIES,
    not a "sprite-class" byte; bank `$05` is the ObjTest viewer path, not the follower path — both
    pre-GFX-4 doc errors, corrected.)
  - `tools/extract_monster_follower_layouts.py` + `extracted/monster_follower_layouts.json` (every
    species → layout id + addresses + sharing). `--selftest` reproduces Healer/DarkDrium anchors and
    confirms all 215 collectible species map.
  - `extracted/follower_layouts.json` REGENERATED & REPLACED — **155 complete layouts** (old 118 dropped
    the 3-entry small/blob layouts), canonical `$10/$11` addresses.
  - **8 follower-art table copies** discovered (`$01 $06 $07 $09 $0b $12 $18 $59`); a consistent swap
    must repoint all 8 (layout/attr are single/shared).
  - `tools/build_follower_reassign.py` — reassignment primitive: clone layout+art+attr from another
    same-bank monster, OR import custom 16-tile art (placed cross-bank, all-8-copies repointed) and set
    layout (default layout 0) + palette. Builds focused test ROMs; clean build stays `1ca6579…`.
  *Original plan (for reference):*
  layouts** (`extracted/follower_layouts.json`). The one remaining link is which layout each
  of the ~215 monsters uses, so the editor can (a) slice imported art into the correct tiles
  automatically, and (b) reassign a monster to a clean non-sharing layout on demand.
  **Known structure (from GFX-3):**
  - Render path: `AdjustGateFloorIndex` (`$01`) sets `$ffc7 = [$ca91]`, base `$ffc9 =
    $20/$30/$40`, calls `$0402` (`NPCSpriteLoadAlt`) → `SaveScr_40cd`.
  - `$ffc7 = [$ca91] = GetActiveMonsterStatus` return = `$01` (if bit7 of `[$cb0b]`) else
    `[$caca] + $10`. So a monster's layout is driven by its **sprite-class byte `[$caca]`**.
  - The 118 layouts are the **level-2** frame-pointer tables (6 ptrs each: down/right/up × 2),
    living in banks `$05`/`$10`/`$11`. A **level-1** table indexes them by `$ffc7`, with the
    BANK chosen by `$ffc7` magnitude (`NPCInteractDispatch` routing: `<$10`→`$04`,
    `$10–$8F`→`$10` (sub `$10`), `≥$90`→`$11` (sub `$90`)). Bank starts are code, so the
    level-1 tables are NOT at `$4000` — they must be located.
  - **TODO:** (1) locate the level-1 dispatch table(s) per bank; (2) extract each monster's
    `[$caca]` sprite-class from the monster data table; (3) compose monster → `$ffc7` → layout
    id; emit `extracted/monster_follower_layouts.json`; (4) wire into `follower_frame_picker.html`
    + `build_sprite_swap.py` so imports default to a non-sharing layout and reassignment is a
    same-size `[$caca]` edit. **Accept:** every monster maps to a layout; a distinct-art import
    on any monster renders clean (matching the DarkDrium-dragon result).


### T1

- [x] **T1 — Re-section keystone (bank `$47`). DONE (S43, byte-perfect).**
      `tools/resection_text_bank.py` converts a corpus bank's contiguous DTE string run
      from mgbdis fake-instructions to `TextStr_<bank>_<addr>:` + `db` blocks (one label
      per text id, decoded text in a comment), labels/comments only. Region from data
      (first string addr `text_id_map.json`; end = bank trailing-fill scan); `R_start/R_end`
      snapped to real line boundaries via a probe-build line→address map (same machinery as
      `resection_library_tables.py`) so no fake instruction is split; emits exact ROM bytes.
      Idempotent, re-runnable from clean tree. **bank `$47`: 69 strings, run `$4174-$5b74`,
      5607 fake lines replaced; clean build stays `1ca6579…`, integrity PASS 4/4.** Method +
      per-bank bounds in TEXT_SYSTEM.md "Source re-section". *Accept met:* bank reads as
      labeled `db` with decoded comments; MD5 unchanged.


### S1

- [x] **S1 — Skill data foundation + round-trip keystone (S44).** *Reshaped on audit:* the
      bank `$52` function table was already re-sectioned, so the real work was the data tables.
      Decoded + FAQ-validated `SkillMPCostTable` ($07:$570C) and `SkillLearnReqTable`
      ($06:$50E0, incl. prereqs); `gen_skill_records.py` → `skill_records.json` (222 records,
      `kind` = 155 skill / 37 item_effect / 30 internal, family-cut codes, monster/enemy usage);
      `build_skill_tables.py --selftest` proves the function/MP/learn tables re-emit
      **byte-identical**. Corrected bank `$52` header ($4211→$6CC7, 256→222, 140→115). Found id
      215 "Sheldodge" = the **Bug-family cut**; renamed → "BugCut" in `patches/bank_041.asm`
      (**SameBoy-confirmed**). Comment-only annotation of the two tables in `bank_006/007`
      (flagged the `TilesetLookupTable` mislabel at `$570C`; rename + full `dw` re-section
      deferred pending SameBoy confirmation of the `$56E8` fn role). MD5 unchanged; integrity PASS.


### S2a

  - [x] **S2a — Alias EFFECTS POC (S45, SameBoy-confirmed).** Net-new ids $DE "Scorch"
        (reuses Blaze handler) + $DF "Smite" (NEW handler, 80 dmg) on starter EID 1, via the
        **skill-alias framework** (commit-time templatize to Blaze + `$db86` stash + `$db8a==0`
        guard + `FarSkillFork`). Works in battle. **Narrow:** single custom-caster, Blaze-shaped
        presentation only; enemy-real-Blaze edge case unclosed. `BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM.md` §1–§6.


### S2b

  - [x] **S2b — Presentation foundation + record round-trip keystone (S46, byte-neutral;
        NOT yet user-tested).** Proved handler=effect TYPE (shared) / record=per-skill params.
        Decoded the **record table** `$54:$4013`→`$41CF` (222×19B): field map FAQ-validated
        (+0 effect_class, +1 effect_category, +2 target_mode, +3 ai_weight, +4 mp_cost,
        +5 status_id, +6 damage_class, +11/+13/+15/+17 power min/range — 31/32 FAQ ranges exact).
        `build_skill_tables.py --selftest` re-emits ptr table + data **byte-identical**; the 4218B
        block **re-sectioned to `db`** in `bank_054.asm`. Decoded the **item-effect/meat** system
        (`$52:$4625`, meat 194–198 → `$58:$591E`) and the **animation dispatch** (`$52:$5460–$54f8`
        → `$dd6f`/`$dd70` → bank `$4c`/`$55`). MD5 unchanged, integrity PASS. `BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM.md` §7–§10.


### S2c

  - [x] **S2c — Effect-script MESSAGE format (RE, discovery). [2026-06-28]**
        *Reframed on RE:* bank `$4c` is **not** a novel effect-bytecode interpreter — it is the
        shared text VM, and the `$dd70/71` "pointer" is a **packed pair of message ids** (low=hit,
        high=miss) resolved via the mode-0 two-level table at `$4c:$4019`. *Accept met +
        validated:* Blaze `$b882` decoded to bytes (`$4c:529f` + `$4c:5871`); **67/67**
        statically-resolved skills' messages cross-checked against the categorized FAQ

        The `$dd68` renderer is a **metasprite/OAM engine** (same 4-byte `dy,dx,tile,attr`

        *Reuse* a known animation on a new id = table edit (`$58dd/$59c3/$5aa9`). *Authoring a
        novel animation* = add metasprite frame lists + a `$4071`-table entry (now fully
        specified; **remaining static-only:** per-bank table extent + tile-graphics VRAM source).


### S2d-audit

  - [x] **S2d-audit — Skill-ID bucketing audit (de-aliasing FOUNDATION, RE/discovery). [S48, 2026-06-28]**
        Byte-neutral. The prerequisite S45 skipped: a complete map of where the engine buckets the
        working skill id (`$db8a`, 254 reads / 9 banks). **Surface reduces to a small verified fork
        set** — 204 equality reads (max `$C5`, custom id matches none), 15 windowed range gates (fall

### S2e-orig (deleted, superseded)

  - [ ] **S2e-orig (superseded desc) — Custom skill #2 (prove the system generalizes).** Add a skill of a
        DIFFERENT shape than MagicBurn to stress parts skill #1 didn't: a **non-damage** skill
        (ally heal, a buff, or a status effect) and/or a **single-target** one. *Accept:* it
        works in SameBoy with its own record/handler/name/announce/presentation, no aliasing.
        **SHOVEL-READY:** follow the 5-step recipe in **§13.4** — each layer is a one-line edit;
        nothing is rebuilt. Watch the two open follow-ups in §13.4 (custom-id skill-NAME insert
        for name-inserting announce templates; a 2nd bespoke-message render path beyond `$FD`) —
        a heal that reuses a self-contained stock announce template hits neither.


### Recommended-order (old)

**Recommended order:** T1 ✅ → S1 ✅ → S2a ✅ → S2b ✅ (S46) → S2c-msg ✅ → S2c-anim ✅ → S2d-audit ✅ (S48) → S2d ✅ (S49, skill #1 live) → **S2e** (next — custom skill #2) / S2f (field skill) / S3 → S4 → M1 → M2 → M3 / T2-roll-out,
slotting the text roll-out into spare sessions. Cheap high-confidence wins early; fire the
two RE discovery sessions (M1, S3) before their authoring items depend on them.

### N1

- [x] **N1 — Scope / RE + slot map (DONE, Session 28).** `tools/map_species_slots.py`
      + `extracted/species_slot_map.json` (256-slot map, self-checking). Verified:
      single indexers (info `$03:SaveMon_4446` ×43, enemy-stats `$14:LoadEnemyStats`
      ×25 with 16-bit EID); slot geography (215–219 special, 220–223 empty, 224–255
      free); the 4 hand-decoded top-range `cp`-ladder sites (flagged for N6 — since
      RESOLVED as `$db8a` skill/effect gates, NOT species gates) vs ~40 false-positive
      `cp $dd` hits. No bytes changed; integrity PASS 4/4.


### N2

- [x] **N2 — Info-table fork (keystone). DONE (S29 impl, S30 verified + made reproducible).**
      `SaveMon_4446`/`label443f` forked zero-shift (id ≥ 224 → bank `$6A` high table via
      `ld hl,$6a00; rst $10`); `MonsterInfoTable` stays pinned at `$4461`, ids 0–220
      byte-identical (only the 2 B6 family-byte reassigns differ). Authored by
      `tools/build_new_species.py` (`extracted/new_species.json` → `patches/bank_06a.asm`),
      byte-exact round-trip validated. Gorbunok (id 224 = Dracky info, family→Slime).
      *Accept met:* id 224 loads correct 43 B; clean build `1ca6579…`; SameBoy-confirmed
      (S30: caught, correct Slime-family stats).


### N3

- [x] **N3 — Enemy-stats. DONE (no fork needed).** EID is 16-bit, so a new entry placed in
      bank `$14` trailing free at EID×25+`$4C1D` is read by vanilla `LoadEnemyStats` with no
      code change. EID 518 → `$14:$7EB3` (Slime EID 2 clone, monster_id→224). Tool
      `build_new_species.py` → `patches/bank_014.asm`. SameBoy-confirmed (S30: fightable/
      catchable). Wild-encounter wiring: same-size `EncounterPoolData` edit (pool 0 slot 3 =
      EID 518 wt 1), tool-owned in `patches/bank_001.asm` (S30 — was a hand-edit before).


### N4

- [x] **N4 — Sprite + palette. DONE (user-confirmed v7).** Tool
      `tools/build_new_species_follower.py` builds a standalone test ROM (patches/ untouched,
      clean build stays byte-perfect) giving id 224 a real follower + battle sprite + palettes:
      • **Follower art:** all **8** gfx-ID copies forked byte-neutral to a real overflow stream
        (`$7e00`); the overworld loader `GetActiveMonsterStatus` ($01) clamp narrowed `cp $e0`→`cp $e1`
        so id 224 reaches the fork (the placeholder clamp had pinned it to DarkDrium).
      • **Follower layout:** level-1 slot `$11:$413f` → Armorpion's layout-0 level-2 `$4184` (proven
        upright, matches `pack_png_layout0`).
      • **Follower attr (palette + flip):** the per-species attr read (`HramUnk11_406e`) overshoots its
        87-entry table into live layout data at `$418d=$41` — bit6 was a stray **Y-flip** (upside-down
        tiles) and low3=1 the **green** palette. Forked the read (`$11:$406e`→`$792d`) to hand id 224 a
        clean attr (no flip, OBJ palette 2 = blue). Both cosmetic bugs were this one overshoot byte.
      • **Battle:** gfx `$00:$2d5f` `$320f`→`$7e01`; palette reader `label17_41d0` forked (resolver
        `$17:$6ce0`) to a custom blue palette. (Full mechanism: MONSTER_DATA.md "NEW species followers".)
      **Follow-up status:** the **FOLLOWER half is now baked into `patches/*.asm`** — Milestone **G1,
      DONE (S34, user-playtested OK, all 4 directions).** id-indexed (content-sized) gfx-ID tables in all
      8 banks, layout slot, attr fork, clamp; new `patches/bank_011/059/07e.asm` + tool
      `tools/bake_follower_overflow.py`; in verify_integrity PATCH lists; integrity PASS 4/4.
      Orientation fixed at root: art stored **un-flipped** (no `--flip-y`), clean-attr mask **`$B8`**
      (preserves the engine's bit5 X-flip for LEFT). The **BATTLE half is now baked too** — Milestone
      **G2, DONE (this session).** Battle gfx `$00:$2d5f` `$320f`→`$7e01` (a **same-size 2-byte repoint**,
      no fork: the species-indexed gfx table `$2b9f` has a real padding slot for id 224, unlike the
      follower tables that overshoot); the dragon battle pose packed as a 2nd overflow entry
      (`Battle_sp224` @ `$7e01`, follower stays `$7e00`) by the extended `tools/bake_follower_overflow.py`
      (`--battle-art/--battle-spec`); battle palette reader `label17_41d0` forked byte-neutral to
      `HighBattlePal` in bank `$17` filler tail (id≥224 → custom blue palette `67 4d ff 6b ff 7f 00 00`,
      else vanilla `$62fd+species*8`). New `examples/follower_swap/gorbunok_battle.json`; bank `$000/017/07e`
      in verify_integrity PATCH lists already; integrity PASS 4/4, user-playtested OK. (Full mechanism:
      MONSTER_DATA.md "NEW species battle sprite".)  **Remaining new-species item → G3:** new_species.json
      schema fold.


### N5

- [x] **N5 — Name + joinability + breeding/library wiring. DONE (S32, user-tested).** Name
      DONE ("Gorbunok" @ `$41:$7E46`). Library DONE + reproducible. Joinability via EID 2 clone.
      **Breeding now DONE — all three paths, user-confirmed:**
      - **Result-path:** Snaily(4) × BattleRex(42) → Gorbunok, a verified-free cross (no special,
        no family default) appended in `extracted/breeding_special.json`. `build_breeding.py`
        extended to admit a declared new-species id (>220) as a recipe result. Bank `$69`.
      - **Parent-path:** works with zero new code — breeding loads parent family via the forked
        `$0301` loader, so Gorbunok resolves to its Slime family `$F0`. Verified by simulation +
        user playtest (Funkybird×Gorbunok→Picky, Dran×Gorbunok→DragonKid, Gorbunok×Funkybird→
        Healer, AntEater×Gorbunok→Tonguella, Gorbunok×AntEater→SpotSlime).
      - **Display-path:** `FamilyRecipeResolve` (`patches/bank_016.asm`) returns the parent pair
        `db $04,$2a` so the encyclopedia shows the Snaily+BattleRex icons.
      - **Hatch:** crashed on the first build — bank `$0b` follower-gfx copy overshot for id 224
        (user pinned via SameBoy breakpoint `$0b:$48ac`). Fixed with `FollowerArtResolve0b`
        (`patches/bank_00b.asm`), same byte-neutral pattern as `$07/$09/$18`.
      - **Default-nickname / "take X with you" narration:** both used the 2-letter `FamilyCode`
        short-name table (`$4739`, 215 entries) which overshot for id 224 into `ItemName[9]` =
        "SkyBell". Fixed via `LoadModeBaseRedirect` (16 bytes in the `$00F0` ROM0 padding,
        `patches/bank_000.asm`): mode-7 lookups for id≥224 redirect to a new-species SHORT-name
        entry (first 4 letters, "Gorb") at bank `$41` tail (`$7FF9`). Generic (no per-monster
        handcoding); gated on `$4739` so all other text is byte-identical.
      - **[x] SUB-ITEM (DONE, S38 — user-confirmed in SameBoy):** library/encyclopedia lineage
        showed parent *icons* correctly but "?????" next to each instead of "Snaily"/"BattleRex".
        Root cause (S32): the parent-name line is rendered via `LoadItem_6456` (`$12:$6456`) → bank
        `$4d` entry 2, **mode 0 = line 1** (`$4d:$400b`), indexed by the **offspring** id; slot 224
        held the vanilla shared "?????    ?????" placeholder @ `$53C4` (256-entry table, NOT an
        overshoot — un-authored slot, shared with 220/225). **FIX (S38):** first verified from clean
        source that the lineage path routes through the fork (bank `$4d` entry 2 = `call SetB4d_43b9`
        → `HighDetailTextFork` → `HighModeTable4D` for id≥224), then wired `HighModeTable4D` mode-0 →
        new `HighMode0Ptrs` → `GorbunokRecipeLine` (`patches/bank_04d.asm`). **Also corrected a
        latent format bug** in the S32-staged string: real recipe lines use TWO fixed 9-char fields
        (e.g. slot 200 "Servant  GreatDrak", slot 214 "DeathMoreWatabou"), so the single-spaced
        staged string would have mis-columned parent 2 — rebuilt as `"Snaily   BattleRex"` (names
        sym-verified vs `MonsterNamePtrTable $41:$4339`). id≥224-gated → ids 0–223 byte-identical;
        built-ROM check `[mode0base+224*2] → GorbunokRecipeLine` → "Snaily   BattleRex". Test ROM
        `DWM-lineage-fix-v1.gbc`. Breeding itself unaffected. **Phase N now has only G3 open.**


### N6

- [x] **N6 — Top-range gates verified (DONE, S31): NOT species gates → no patch.**
      `bank_05f/057/058/052` all branch on `$db8a`, which is a battle skill/effect/
      animation id (written only from constants + skill tables), never a species byte.
      A new species 224 cannot reach them, so they were false positives in the S28
      slot-map. Phase N requires no species-gate patch. (Detail in MONSTER_DATA.md
      "Species ID geography" → N6; DOC_AUDIT.md.)


### S29 trailing blockquote (all items resolved or folded into G3)

> **S29 progress (stage1ac / Gorbunok id 224 track).** The **encyclopedia DETAIL page
> freeze** — the last blocker for the new-species *display* feature set — is FIXED
> (`TEXT_SYSTEM.md`): the text engine's mode×species double indirection
> (`SaveBankAndSwitch $092F`) overshot the 215-entry line-2 description table at
> `$4D:$420B`. Forked via `HighDetailTextFork` (`patches/bank_04d.asm`). Also fixed the
> independent 222-entry `FamilyRecipeTable` overshoot (`FamilyRecipeResolve`,
> `patches/bank_016.asm`). Detail page user-confirmed clean (mirrors Dracky), ROM
> `DWM-Gorbunok-stage1ac-v16.gbc`. Every species-indexed table and its overshoot status

>
> **Next steps / deferred (next session):**
> 1. **Custom Gorbunok sprite + palette** (the N4 work) — currently a DarkDrium
>    placeholder (`MonsterBattleGfxTable[224]=$320F`); follower sprite also deferred.
> 2. **Bespoke Gorbunok description string** — line 2 currently reuses Dracky's
>    (`$60BC`) as a valid placeholder; author a real string (needs font-glyph encoding
>    like the name) and point `HighLine2Ptrs[0]` at it.
> 3. **Optional: make Gorbunok breedable** — wild-only today (recipe = `$FF,$FF`); both
>    the result-path (`SpecialRecipeTable` append) and parent-path (extend
>    `FamilyRecipeResolve`) are documented in `BREEDING_SYSTEM.md`.
> 4. **Re-check N4/N5/N6 formal acceptance** against the stage1ac implementation and
>    tick the boxes whose acceptance tests are now met.
