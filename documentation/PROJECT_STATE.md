# PROJECT STATE — Single Source of Truth

> **This file is the entry point for every session.** It is the only document
> allowed to state project-wide status. Other docs are subject-specific
> references and must not duplicate status claims. If this file and another
> doc disagree, this file wins — and the session should fix the other doc.

> **Size discipline (S51):** this file keeps only the latest TWO session
> blocks verbose. Older blocks move VERBATIM to `SESSION_HISTORY.md` (a cold
> archive — do NOT read it at session start; every fact in it already lives
> in the owning reference doc). The Session Index below is the finding aid.

## Canonical Facts (verified, do not trust other copies)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Original ROM MD5 | `1ca6579359f21d8e27b446f865bf6b83` |
| Clean build target | MUST equal the MD5 above, byte-perfect |
| Assembler | RGBDS v0.6.1 exactly |
| ROM size | 2 MB, 128 banks ($00–$7F) |
| Custom content bank | $60 (verifier check 2 prints current usage — 1,393 B as of S51) |
| Monster battle palette table | `MonsterBattlePalettes` @ `$17:$62FD`, 8 B/species, 4 RGB555 `[c0, c1=$6bff, c2, c3=$0000]`; loaded by bank $17 entry 6 (`$1706`). Was mislabeled `RoomAttrDataBlocks`. |
| Monster sprite overflow banks | `$7E,$7F` (then `$7C,$7A,$79`) — cross-bank sprite streams (`dwm/sprite_bank.py`); EDITOR_DESIGN §8. Resolver reads `$<bank>:$4001+index*2`, no bank gating. |
| Follower gfx-ID table | `ScreenTransDataTable` @ `$01:$49DF`, 231 `dw`, indexed `species+$10`; loader `GetActiveMonsterStatus` @ `$01:$4986`; family table `FollowerFamilyGfxTable` @ `$01:$4BAD` (10). 16 tiles / 256 B per follower, DMA'd to VRAM `$8200`/`$8300`/`$8400` (party slot 0/1/2). **8 parallel copies of this gfx-ID table exist** (`$01 $06 $07 $09 $0b $12 $18 $59`, one per UI context: `$18`=menu/`TextDataPtrLookup`@`$4123` indexed `species`, `$12`=library); a complete art swap repoints ALL 8. |
| Follower layout dispatch (GFX-4) | Level-1 tables at FIXED `$10:$407f` (species 0–127) / `$11:$407f` (species 128+), indexed by species; `$ffc7=species+$10` routed by bank-`$04` entry 2 (`$10–$8F`→bank `$10`, `≥$90`→bank `$11`). Per-species attr/palette byte at `$10:$417f` / `$11:$412d` (bit6=Y-flip, bit5=X-flip, low3=OBJ palette). `[$caca]` = SPECIES (party +$09), not a "sprite-class" byte. Bank `$05` `$407f`-style table is the ObjTest viewer, NOT the follower path. `extracted/monster_follower_layouts.json`. |
| Follower render engine | `SaveScr_40cd` @ `$04:$40cd` (GBC variant of ROM0 `$0d91`). Metasprite list = 4-byte entries **(dy, dx, tile_offset, attr)**, `$80`-terminated; OAM tile = `tile_offset + [$ffc9]` (base `$20/$30/$40`); OAM attr = `[$ffca] XOR attr` (X-flip bit5). 2-level table: sprite-type `$ffc7`(=`[$ca91]`) → frame/dir `$ffc8`. **OBJ idx0 = hardware-transparent** (battle BG used idx1). 8 OBJ palettes @ `$17:$5615`. |
| Follower layout library | **155 distinct layouts** (complete; regenerated by `tools/extract_monster_follower_layouts.py` from the real `$10/$11:$407f` tables — the old 118-count brute-force scan dropped 3-entry small/blob layouts). Layout is per-species. Reassignment = same-size 2-byte repoint of the species' `$407f` level-1 entry (same-bank only), NOT a `[$caca]` edit. `extracted/follower_layouts.json`. |
| Custom layout bank | $64 (layout ptr table + LZSS layout + attr data, 309 bytes used) |
| Vanilla-empty banks | 23 = 368 KB: $60,$64,$67,$69–$77,$79–$7A,$7C,$7E–$7F (full-ROM scan, DOC_AUDIT B). Current allocation: see Bank Allocation table below. |
| Gate floor generation | Standard floors are procedurally generated (4×4 screen grid `$C940`, `(piece<<4)\|variant`); special/boss rooms are fixed templates substituted in. Per-gate config `GateFloorDataTable` `$16:$70A6` (32×8); weighting via `SelectFloorType` `$16:$5FC0` + `FloorTypeSelectionTable`1/2/3. Special-room insertion = `rst $00` dispatch at `$16:$5C1C` (sets `wMapID` + `wInGateworld=0`). **Full pipeline: GATE_GENERATION.md.** |
| Gate damage tiles | Standing-tile id → HRAM `$AA` (`$00:$1E96`); behavior class `$AA>>2`: `$0E` (ids `$38–$3B`) = damage, `$0F` (`$3C–$3F`) = staircase. Amount = `FloorDamageTable` `$01:$5E7D` (16 B by floor type): type 3→5, type 6→10, types $0C/$0E→2, else 0. Applier `ApplyFloorDamage` `$01:$5E23`. (GATE_GENERATION.md §5.1.) |
| Room palette derivation | A room's runtime BG palette is ROM-derivable: real colours are only indices 0 & 2 of slots 0–3 (`$17:$476F`[mapID] normal / `$17:$51F5`[floortype] gate, scanning past empty screens); engine FORCES idx1=`$6bff`, idx3=`$0000` in every BG palette; slots 4–7 shared system; object palettes global at `$17:$5615`. `tools/derive_room_palette.py`, validated 30/30 dumps + gate. (GATE_GENERATION.md §7.1.) |
| Verifier | `python3 tools/verify_integrity.py` — run at session start AND end |

**The MD5 `b90957482011c8083a068781033715b7` is WRONG.** It was a drifted
build produced when commits `2000e99`/`036dc06` refactored bank $0B code
(inline pointer chases → `call SharedPtrChase`), shifting ~2,282 bytes. A
session then rewrote the handoff doc to "bless" the drifted hash. Restored
to byte-perfect on 2026-06-13 by reverting bank_00b.asm to the e78eb1d
version (+1 symbol rename). Any doc still citing `b909...` is stale.


### Bank allocation (custom-content banks; single source of truth)

| Bank | Owner | Emitted by |
|------|-------|-----------|
| $60 | Custom rooms / NPCs / scripts / text | hand-authored `patches/bank_060.asm` (→ `build_project.py` later) |
| $64 | Custom tile layouts + attr data | `tile_layout_compiler.py`, `build_gate_room.py`, `generate_attr_map.py` |
| $67 | Combined-tileset GFX (multi-tileset mashup) | `build_combined_tileset.py` |
| $69 | Breeding special table + scanner (B5 owns the whole table) | `build_breeding.py --emit-special` |
| $6A | New-species info high table (ids 224+) | `build_new_species.py` |
| $71 | Custom-room dispatch tables (S42 keystone: `Custom26DDTable`, `RoomEncTable`; + `CustomRoomBGMTable` + resolver entry 2, S64) | compiler-generated `patches/bank_071.asm` (template head + tables; S63 `--apply` route) |
| $72 | Custom-skill system (de-aliased S2d/S2e code + tables) | hand-authored `patches/bank_072.asm` |

| $7E | Sprite overflow streams (battle + follower art) | `dwm/sprite_bank.py`, `bake_follower_overflow.py` |
| $7F | RESERVED next sprite-overflow bank (then $7C, $7A, $79) | `dwm/sprite_bank.py` order |

## Iron Rules

1. **Clean disassembly is never refactored.** No `jp`→`jr`, no shared-helper
   extraction, no "optimization" in `disassembly/`. All such changes go in
   `patches/`. Annotation = labels and comments ONLY (zero byte impact).
2. **Never insert bytes into banks $01, $04, $17** (raw embedded pointers).
   Same-size replacements or wrappers in end-of-bank padding only.
3. **Never `make clean`** — it deletes committed `.2bpp` binaries that cannot
   be regenerated identically. Remove only `game.o game.gbc game.sym game.map`.
4. **`verify_integrity.py` must PASS before any commit.**
5. **When in doubt, grep the ROM/disassembly for how the original does it.**
   Documentation has been wrong before ($E7 ≠ END; opcode $04 ≠ give item).

### Custom content primitives (proven in-game)

| Primitive | Status | Where |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Add NEW monster species (ids 224–255) | 🟢 Gorbunok (id 224) fully integrated & baked: info/stats/wild-encounter/name/library/breeding(3 paths)/lineage/follower art/battle art (S28–S38, user-confirmed). Open: **G3** schema fold (ROADMAP). | ROADMAP Phase N; MONSTER_DATA "Species ID geography" + "NEW species followers/battle sprite" |
| Custom rooms (mapID ≥ $6B) | ✅ table-driven to editor scale: render/palette/attr/$26DD records + per-room encounters via bank $71 tables (S40/S42); multi-screen scroll (v28); gate-rotation insertion + descent (S41). | EDITOR_DESIGN §2; GATE_GENERATION §7; CROSSBANK_ROOMS |
| Custom NPCs with scripts | ✅ working | bank $60 entry 4 dispatch |
| Custom text, multi-page, line breaks | ✅ working | IDs $0A00+, two-level ptr table |
| YES/NO choices with branching | ✅ working | $E7 $F0 + opcode $15 on $C83C |
| Item give + inventory-full check | ✅ working | opcodes $2A (wrapped) / $2C |
| Monster/egg give + storage-full check | ✅ working | opcodes $29 (wrapped) / $28; egg path is the practical choice |
| Script-driven teleport | ✅ working | opcode $0F (MapTransitionFull); vanilla + custom destinations |
| BGM change | ✅ working | opcode $41 (SetBGM); reverts to the ROOM DEFAULT on exit/reload |
| Room-default music (vanilla + custom rooms) | ✅ working (S64, user-confirmed v6): `music.room_defaults`/`rooms[].music` → `CustomRoomBGMTable` (bank $71 entry 2) consulted first by the rewritten `LoadNewBGMIdIntoA`; survives save/reload by construction; sources = inbuilt ids, DWM2 catalog (all 31), MIDI conversions | SOUND_SYSTEM §8; PROJECT_COMPILER §2.9 |
| Event flags set/clear/check | ✅ working | opcodes $00/$01/$03; 328 referenced, 298 with sets (branch-following) |
| NPC show/hide by step | ✅ working | step system; counters at $DE74+ (S55 relocation); opcode $12 advances (v25) |
| LZSS tile compressor | ✅ working | tools/compress_tiles.py, roundtrip verified |
| Custom tile layouts + tileset selection | ✅ working | bank $64 + tile_layout_compiler.py; MapIDClampForPalette ROM0 $3FE8 |
| Custom tile GRAPHICS (multi-tileset mashup) | ✅ working end-to-end (S6–S10): editor JSON → build_combined_tileset.py → bank $67/$17 patches. Remaining = editor multi-screen UI. | KEY_LESSONS S5–S8; TOOLS_AND_DATA |
| Attr map generator | ✅ working | tools/generate_attr_map.py (85 tilesets) |
| Script compiler/decompiler | ✅ working | tools/compile_script.py / decompile_script.py |
| Random encounters in custom rooms | ✅ generalized per-room (S42 `RoomEncTable`, bank $71). Remaining: custom monster POOLS (Encounters #2, ROADMAP). | CROSSBANK_ROOMS; KEY_LESSONS S11 |
| Custom breeding | ✅ full authoring stack B1–B7: round-trip encoder; bank $69 owns the special table (overrides+appends+shadow validator); family-defaults rewrite; family reassignment; production library grouping (zero lag). B9 11th-family icon shipped; tab wiring open. | BREEDING_SYSTEM; ROADMAP Phase 2B |
| Custom battle skills (net-new ids) | 🟢 FOUR custom skills live: MagicBurn $E0 (S49), Tame $E1 (S50), TameMore $E2 + TameMost $E3 (S52) — a 3-tier evolve chain on the full de-aliased stack incl. natural-learn (LearnLoopFork), real MP (MPPtrFromId, 10/30/50), announce (AnnounceIdxFork). Crank reverted S52; meter tiers 10/100/400. Learn/upgrade user-confirmed; MP charge + meter values built S52, NOT yet user-tested. | BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM §12–§13.6; ROADMAP Arc 2 |
| SRAM save layout | ✅ audited S8: custom flags persist (truly-safe pool = 32 flags, S57); collisions mapped; free SRAM tail $BFC8-$BFFF (56 B, reserved). 32 KB expansion audited S65: BLOCKED on RAMB discipline (E3) | ARCHITECTURE (incl. "SRAM banking" S65); known_RAM_map |
| Custom-room WRAM state | ✅ migrated S65 into the CF3-freed window (buffers $CC80/$CD00, counter region $CD80×640, wCustomPool $D001-$D664; TRANSIENT permanently, init-guaranteed zeroed). v7 USER-CONFIRMED S66 | patches/wram.asm banner; PROJECT_COMPILER §2.6; ROADMAP CF4 |

### Not yet implemented

| System | State |
|--------|-------|
| Custom monster pools (Encounters #2) | Specced in CROSSBANK_ROOMS; not built |
| Custom music | 🟢 **M1-M3c COMPLETE (S61-S64, all user-confirmed)**: engine map, round-trip codec, general slots (bank $74), room-default assignment for any mapID, `custom.music` schema, 31-song DWM2 catalog, MIDI import. Open boxes: InitBGM channel-count ext (4/5ch sources), gate/event music, CI compiler-test |
| Editor app (Phase 3) | Not started; backend keystone (S42) done |

### Disassembly annotation (measured 2026-06-13, not estimated)

Objective metric: meaningful (non-auto) labels + comment density per bank.

| Tier | Banks | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Fully annotated (11) | $00 $03 $04 $0B $0C $0D $0E $0F $13 $14 $41 | Core engine + script data banks |
| Useful partial (≈14) | $01 (36%) $16 (30%) $17 (75%) $50 (21%) $51 (27%) $52 (36%) and tileset banks $23–$31/$37/$38 (data-only, trivially "done") | Post-S43 arcs also deepened $47 $54 $5f (not re-measured) |
| Effectively raw (~80) | everything else | mgbdis output, auto labels |

All 2,404 function entry points are named repo-wide, but most bank
*internals* are raw. **Data tables inside raw banks are still misassembled as
fake instructions**, which blocks direct editing in source (ROADMAP Phase D/F
re-section items).

### Open defects

- Tame per-enemy hit-blink NOT IMPLEMENTED (cosmetic; deferred by user S52 — "bank it").
  The MECHANISM IS SOLVED (S52, HW-confirmed): enemy is BG-drawn; blink = tilemap toggle
  in bank `$5f` entry 5 (`$da83` phase → `$da84` sub-dispatch `$4b99`). Full map +
  implementation plan: BATTLE_SKILL_SYSTEM §11.7.
- S52 items built but NOT yet user-tested: MP charging (10/30/50), meter tier values
  (10/100/400), the "!" page-split upgrade message. Marked in §13.6.
- ~~`extracted/skills.json` is superseded by `skill_records.json` but still read by
  `gen_name_tables_db.py` — retire (ROADMAP box).~~ **RESOLVED S59 — and the claim was
  inverted:** `gen_name_tables_db.py` declared the path but never opened it; the real
  readers were `gen_skill_table_db.py`, `gen_enemy_stats_db.py`, `gen_monster_db.py`.
  All ported to `skill_records.json`; `skills.json` DELETED; `dump_skills.py` is an
  inert tombstone. Root cause of its 34 junk records: the 222-entry skill function
  table (`$52:$4011..$41CC`) read as 256, overrunning into `SkillBlaze` (`$52:$41CD`).
  (DOC_AUDIT S59; KEY_LESSONS S59.)
- DOC_AUDIT.md's full-corpus audit is dated 2026-06-13; later findings are dated
  addenda inside it, not a re-audit.
- `dump_monsters.py` WRITES the legacy `monsters.json` schema (43-byte parse) while
  READING `monsters_full.json` for names — TOOLS_AND_DATA's Tier-A attribution
  "monsters_full.json ← dump_monsters.py" is suspect (the legacy note says
  `randomize.py` writes monsters_full). Verify the real generator before relying on
  regen; don't re-run dump_monsters casually (it recreates the deleted legacy file).
