# PROJECT STATE — Single Source of Truth

> User goal: brand-new species (not reskins). Species id is a single byte → hard 256
> ceiling; ids 215–219 are special (215 `TERRY?` one-off enemy; 216–219 Tatsu/Diago/

> **first free id is 224 (`$E0`), budget 32 (224–255)**. Architecture chosen: **high-table
> + single forked loader, vanilla 0–220 byte-identical** — each per-species table has ONE
> arithmetic indexer to fork (`if id < 224 → vanilla, else → free-bank high-table`).
> Verified single indexers: monster info `$03:SaveMon_4446` (×43; all 16 consumers read
> the `$DA33` copy), enemy stats `$14:LoadEnemyStats` (×25, **16-bit EID** → no 256 wall on
> the battle side). The ceiling is NOT one clean gate: ~40 `cp $dd`/`cp $de` hits are
> false positives (interrupt boilerplate + misassembled data); only 4 real top-range
> special-case gates (`$5f/$57/$58/$52`) need the N6 "treats ≥224 as normal" check.
> Deliverable: `tools/map_species_slots.py` + `extracted/species_slot_map.json` (256-slot

## Canonical Facts (verified, do not trust other copies)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Original ROM MD5 | `1ca6579359f21d8e27b446f865bf6b83` |
| Clean build target | MUST equal the MD5 above, byte-perfect |
| Assembler | RGBDS v0.6.1 exactly |
| ROM size | 2 MB, 128 banks ($00–$7F) |
| Custom content bank | $60 (~14.9 KB free as of v25 content, 1322 bytes used) |
| Monster battle palette table | `MonsterBattlePalettes` @ `$17:$62FD`, 8 B/species, 4 RGB555 `[c0, c1=$6bff, c2, c3=$0000]`; loaded by bank $17 entry 6 (`$1706`). Was mislabeled `RoomAttrDataBlocks`. |
| Monster sprite overflow banks | `$7E,$7F` (then `$7C,$7A,$79`) — cross-bank sprite streams (`dwm/sprite_bank.py`); EDITOR_DESIGN §8. Resolver reads `$<bank>:$4001+index*2`, no bank gating. |
| Follower gfx-ID table | `ScreenTransDataTable` @ `$01:$49DF`, 231 `dw`, indexed `species+$10`; loader `GetActiveMonsterStatus` @ `$01:$4986`; family table `FollowerFamilyGfxTable` @ `$01:$4BAD` (10). 16 tiles / 256 B per follower, DMA'd to VRAM `$8200`/`$8300`/`$8400` (party slot 0/1/2). **8 parallel copies of this gfx-ID table exist** (`$01 $06 $07 $09 $0b $12 $18 $59`, one per UI context: `$18`=menu/`TextDataPtrLookup`@`$4123` indexed `species`, `$12`=library); a complete art swap repoints ALL 8. |
| Follower layout dispatch (GFX-4) | Level-1 tables at FIXED `$10:$407f` (species 0–127) / `$11:$407f` (species 128+), indexed by species; `$ffc7=species+$10` routed by bank-`$04` entry 2 (`$10–$8F`→bank `$10`, `≥$90`→bank `$11`). Per-species attr/palette byte at `$10/$11:$417f` (low 3 bits = OBJ palette). `[$caca]` = SPECIES (party +$09), not a "sprite-class" byte. Bank `$05` `$407f`-style table is the ObjTest viewer, NOT the follower path. `extracted/monster_follower_layouts.json`. |
| Follower render engine | `SaveScr_40cd` @ `$04:$40cd` (GBC variant of ROM0 `$0d91`). Metasprite list = 4-byte entries **(dy, dx, tile_offset, attr)**, `$80`-terminated; OAM tile = `tile_offset + [$ffc9]` (base `$20/$30/$40`); OAM attr = `[$ffca] XOR attr` (X-flip bit5). 2-level table: sprite-type `$ffc7`(=`[$ca91]`) → frame/dir `$ffc8`. **OBJ idx0 = hardware-transparent** (battle BG used idx1). 8 OBJ palettes @ `$17:$5615`. |
| Follower layout library | **155 distinct layouts** (complete; regenerated by `tools/extract_monster_follower_layouts.py` from the real `$10/$11:$407f` tables — the old 118-count brute-force scan dropped 3-entry small/blob layouts). Layout is per-species. Reassignment = same-size 2-byte repoint of the species' `$407f` level-1 entry (same-bank only), NOT a `[$caca]` edit. `extracted/follower_layouts.json`. |
| Custom layout bank | $64 (layout ptr table + LZSS layout + attr data, 309 bytes used) |
| Empty banks available | 21 banks = 336 KB: $67,$69–$77,$79–$7A,$7C,$7E–$7F |
| Verifier | `python3 tools/verify_integrity.py` — run at session start AND end |

**The MD5 `b90957482011c8083a068781033715b7` is WRONG.** It was a drifted
build produced when commits `2000e99`/`036dc06` refactored bank $0B code
(inline pointer chases → `call SharedPtrChase`), shifting ~2,282 bytes. A
session then rewrote the handoff doc to "bless" the drifted hash. Restored
to byte-perfect on 2026-06-13 by reverting bank_00b.asm to the e78eb1d
version (+1 symbol rename). Any doc still citing `b909...` is stale.

## Iron Rules

1. **Clean disassembly is never refactored.** No `jp`→`jr`, no shared-helper
   extraction, no "optimization" in `disassembly/`. All such changes go in
   `patches/`. Annotation = labels and comments ONLY (zero byte impact).
2. **Never insert bytes into banks $01, $04, $17** (raw embedded pointers).
   Same-size replacements or wrappers in end-of-bank padding only.
3. **Never `make clean`** — it deletes committed `.2bpp` binaries that cannot
   be regenerated identically. Remove only `game.o game.gbc game.sym game.map`.
4. **`verify_integrity.py` must PASS before any commit.**
5. **When in doubt, grep the ROM/disassembly for how the original does it.**
   Documentation has been wrong before ($E7 ≠ END; opcode $04 ≠ give item).

## Status Dashboard

### Custom content primitives (proven in-game: v23 base, v25 step system)

| Primitive | Status | Where |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Add NEW monster species (ids 224–255) | 🔬 scoped (S28), N1 done; N2+ open | ROADMAP "Phase N"; mechanics MONSTER_DATA "Species ID geography". Byte-id → 32-slot budget (first free 224). Architecture: high-table + single forked loader, vanilla 0–220 byte-identical. Tool `tools/map_species_slots.py` + `extracted/species_slot_map.json`. NOT yet implemented — N2 (info-table fork) is the first ROM. |
| Custom rooms (mapID ≥ $6B), multi-screen, exits | ✅ working | patches/bank_060.asm + intercepts. Multi-screen scrolling proven (v28): vertical 2-screen Room $6B (screens 0+4). Room dimensions in $26DD bytes 2-5 control walkable area. |
| Custom NPCs with scripts | ✅ working | bank $60 entry 4 dispatch |
| Custom text, multi-page, line breaks | ✅ working | IDs $0A00+, two-level ptr table |
| YES/NO choices with branching | ✅ working | $E7 $F0 + opcode $15 on $C83C |
| Item give + inventory-full check | ✅ working | opcodes $2A (wrapped) / $2C |
| Monster/egg give + storage-full check | ✅ working | opcodes $29 (wrapped) / $28; egg give proven with SkyDragon (EID 350) |
| Script-driven teleport | ✅ working | opcode $0F (MapTransitionFull); vanilla + custom destinations |
| BGM change | ✅ working | opcode $41 (SetBGM); track reverts on room exit |
| Event flags set/clear/check | ✅ working | opcodes $00/$01/$03; 328 used, 298 with sets, ~200 safe+persistent free |
| NPC show/hide by step | ✅ working | CustomPtrChase reads RAM step counter × 6; 2+ step entries per screen; opcode $12 advances counter. Verified in-game v25. |
| LZSS tile compressor | ✅ working | tools/compress_tiles.py, roundtrip verified |
| Custom tile layouts | ✅ working | bank $64 pointer table + LZSS data; tile_layout_compiler.py; MedalMan-tileset room confirmed in-game (v28). Tileset switching via MapIDClampForPalette in ROM0 (hardcoded per-room). Palette attributes fixed: CustomAttrCheck intercept in bank $17 free space ($6C75) decompresses custom nibble-packed attr data from bank $64 entry 1. |
| Custom tileset selection | ✅ working | MapIDClampForPalette at ROM0 $3FE8; Room $6B currently $16 (MedalMan). |
| Attr map generator | ✅ working | tools/generate_attr_map.py; builds tile→palette maps from all 85 tilesets, generates LZSS-compressed attr data. |
| Script compiler/decompiler | ✅ working | tools/compile_script.py / decompile_script.py |
| Random encounters in custom rooms | ✅ working (single room, Strategy A) | Whitelist mapID in $0B:Jump_00b_4674 + pin wGateID/wCurrentFloor (ASM) + arm wEncounterCounter (room-entry script). Pool selectable via gate/floor. v30, runtime-verified. Editor generalization specced (CROSSBANK_ROOMS.md). |
| Custom breeding recipes (special table) | ✅ working (same-size edit + capacity extension) | v31/S12: special-recipe override (Anteater×BattleRex→GoldSlime) via two provably-dead entries; in-game confirmed. Tool `patch_breeding_recipe.py`, `patches/bank_016.asm`. Family table is positional (result=slot index). **S13: round-trip encoder B1 built** (`tools/build_breeding.py`, `extracted/breeding_tables.json`) — both vanilla tables decode/re-emit byte-identical. **S13: B2 relocation** (special scan → free bank `$69` via `rst $10`). **S15: B3 capacity 1×–2×** — `build_breeding.py` appends recipes from `extracted/breeding_extra_recipes.json` past index 824 (cap 1650); BattleRex×MadCat→DracoLord confirmed in-game. **S16: B4 family-defaults rewrite** — `build_breeding.py --emit-family` authors the positional family table in place from `extracted/breeding_family_defaults.json`; Bird/Slime/Beast×Dragon + new Dragon×Dragon→GreatDrak confirmed in-game (5 bytes, zero-collateral). **S17: B5 full special-table authoring** — `build_breeding.py --emit-special` owns the WHOLE special table as authored data (825 ROM base + in-place `overrides` by index/parents + `appends`) from `extracted/breeding_special.json`, with a whole-table first-match-wins shadow validator; bank `$16` stays vanilla (single source = JSON → bank `$69`). Confirmed in-game: MadCat×BattleRex→DracoLord (entry-187 in-place edit), Darkdrium×BattleRex→Armorpion (append), S12 GoldSlime preserved. Supersedes the B3 `--emit-relocation` path. **S18: B6 family reassignment** — `build_family_reassign.py` moves monsters between ANY families (incl. ???/Boss=9) via same-size family-byte edits (`patches/bank_003.asm`); reader gate cleared (display/copy only, eligibility is joinability+boss table, not family). **S18: dynamic-library POC** — `build_dynamic_library.py` redirects `SetItem_6242` ($12) to a family-byte scan so the library groups by reassigned family (`patches/bank_012.asm`); user-confirmed, POC only (lags). **S19: B7 production library grouping (DONE, replaces the POC)** — `build_library_table.py` emits a build-time precomputed family→members table into bank `$12` free space + a zero-shift `SetItem_6242` walker; **zero far-loads, zero scratch RAM**, vanilla blank-slot semantics restored; generic-N (`NUM_FAMILIES`) + 256-id-ceiling extension-aware; special entries 215–220 protected; `extracted/library_grouping.json` data deliverable; user-confirmed in SameBoy (zero lag). Production library now done; 11th family (B9) data side unblocked. Rename (B8) folded into B9 per user decision. |

### Not yet implemented (the roadblocks — see ROADMAP.md)

| System | Blocker |
|--------|---------|
| Random encounters in custom rooms | ✅ PROVEN (Strategy A, Session 11). Mechanism: encounters are gated per-step by a mapID whitelist in `$0B:Jump_00b_4674` (NOT by `wInGateworld`); whitelisting a custom mapID enables them. The battle pool is `GateBasePoolIndex[wGateID]+floor` resolved at battle time, so a non-gate room must pin `wGateID`/`wCurrentFloor` (done in ASM every step) and arm `wEncounterCounter` (room-entry script, since vanilla skips seeding when `wInGateworld=0`). Win+flee return clean; saving still works (no gate mode). **Remaining (editor):** #1 per-room on/off + gate/floor table, #2 custom pools — both specced in CROSSBANK_ROOMS.md, not yet generalized. |
| Custom tile GRAPHICS | Palette attributes fixed (v28). Multi-tileset mashup pipeline working end-to-end (Session 7): editor exports JSON → `build_combined_tileset.py` → ROM patches → playable room with tiles from 4 source tilesets (80 tiles). K-means palette grouping replaced with exact-color matching (10 groups for NORDEN). Game engine forces BG palette color index 1 to shared value ($6BFF) at runtime — build tool swaps EXT palette indices 0↔1 to work around this. Castle VRAM animation at tile indices 77-78 avoided by inserting blanks. Editor has live palette slot counter (X/8) with export validation. **Session 9**: editor tileset PNGs regenerated with runtime-correct palettes via `regenerate_tileset_pngs.py` (all 86 tilesets, using `room_palettes.json`). Force-preview toggle shows colour index 1 marker tint. `--build` flag validated end-to-end (editor export → patched ROM → clean restore). **Session 10**: multi-screen ROM patches working — per-screen layout+attr in bank $64, screen-aware CustomAttrCheck in bank $17, room height in $26DD table. **Remaining**: editor multi-screen UI (screen selector, per-screen canvas, exit/NPC placement); `build_combined_tileset.py` multi-screen export. |
| Custom music | Sound engine unexplored |
| Save-data audit | ✅ Completed Session 8. SRAM save layout fully traced and documented in ARCHITECTURE.md + known_RAM_map.md. Custom flags $0158-$0277 are in save range. Flag byte collisions mapped. Flag $0158 tested in SameBoy: set via NPC script, persisted through save+reload. |

### Disassembly annotation (measured 2026-06-13, not estimated)

Objective metric: meaningful (non-auto) labels + comment density per bank.

| Tier | Banks | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Fully annotated (11) | $00 $03 $04 $0B $0C $0D $0E $0F $13 $14 $41 | Core engine + script data banks |
| Useful partial (≈14) | $01 (36%) $16 (30%) $17 (75%) $50 (21%) $51 (27%) $52 (36%) and tileset banks $23–$31/$37/$38 (data-only, trivially "done") | |
| Effectively raw (~80) | everything else | mgbdis output, auto labels |

All 2,404 function entry points are named repo-wide, but most bank
*internals* are raw. "~45% disassembled" overstates editability: **data
tables inside raw banks are still misassembled as fake instructions**, which
blocks direct editing of monsters/enemies/encounters/breeding in source.

### Known documentation defects (to fix as encountered)

- ~~Two contradictory MD5s across docs~~ → fixed; verifier now polices this.
- README inventory range `$CA21–$CA50` was wrong; **correct: `wInventory` =
  `$CA51`, 20 slots** (ARCHITECTURE.md + patches/wram.asm agree, verified in
  GiveItem handler).
- ~~`extracted/map_table.json` interact/exit labels swapped~~ → fixed;
  `dump_map_table.py` rewritten with verified semantics + $FFFF hole-
  skipping bug also fixed (was dropping a third of rooms).
- NEXT_CLAUDE_MESSAGE.md and SESSION1_ARCHIVE.md are superseded — delete
  (replaced by this file + SESSION_PROTOCOL.md + ROADMAP.md).
- ~~Data layer: tool-behind-data and frozen-source JSONs~~ → ALL RESOLVED.
  `dump_enemy_stats.py` reconciled (full 25-byte decode, 487/487 match);
  new generators written for `skills.json`, `text_id_map.json`,
  `all_scripts.json`; `map_table.json`/`exit_table.json`/
  `room_connections.json` regenerated with fixed decoders; remaining
  JSONs reclassified (hand-authored reference or stable analysis, not
  frozen-source). See TOOLS_AND_DATA.md for the complete audit.
  `monsters.json`, `event_flags.json`, `edits.json` are legacy (deletable).
- KEY_LESSONS.md claims "Bank $0B is safe for insertions" — true for the
  *patched* tree, but this is exactly the loophole that caused the
  byte-perfect drift. Insertions in $0B are allowed **in patches/ only**.
- ~~ROADMAP "NPC show/hide" pointed at opcodes $48/$49 and claimed the
  mechanism was "untraced"~~ → Fixed. The mechanism is the **step
  system** (multiple step entries per screen, counter at $D92A–$D99A
  set by opcode $12). Opcodes $48/$49 are runtime movement-based
  show/hide for cutscenes. Full documentation added to
  ROOM_DATA_FORMAT.md "Room State System", ARCHITECTURE.md RAM map,
  known_RAM_map.md, and CUSTOM_CUTSCENES.md.
- ~~Decompiler opcode names had systematic errors~~ → Fixed. Handler
  code verified against ROM bytes for all critical opcodes. Key fixes:
  $29 was "give_item" (actually AddMonster), $2A was "check_level"
  (actually GiveItem — PROVEN in v23), $41 was "save_map_return"
  (actually SetBGM). Compiler had same errors — "give_item" compiled
  to $29 (AddMonster) instead of $2A (GiveItem). All three tools
  reconciled: decompile_script.py, compile_script.py,
  dump_all_scripts.py. all_scripts.json regenerated.
- ~~Opcodes $00 and $01 names may be swapped~~ → **Confirmed correct
  (no swap).** Verified from assembly: $00 handler does `jp nz, skip`
  after `TestEventFlag`, so it branches when flag is CLEAR =
  "if_flag_clear". $01 handler does `jp z, skip`, so it branches when
  flag is SET = "if_flag_set". `TestEventFlag` returns Z=clear, NZ=set
  via `and [hl]`. Definitively resolved from code; no SameBoy test needed.
- ~~Room $6C step counter addresses $D9A0-$D9A2 collided with event flags~~
  → **Fixed.** $D9A0 = byte 5 of wEventFlags (boss defeat flags $0028-
  $002F: DracoLord, Zoma, Baramos, Pizzaro, Esterk, etc.), $D9A1 = byte 6
  (story flags $0030-$0037 with up to 62 uses each), $D9A2 = byte 7
  (MedalMan, Castle flags $0038-$003F). Writing step counter values there
  would clobber critical game state. Never triggered in practice because
  CustomPtrChase ignored step counters. Fixed by moving all custom step
  counters to $D478-$D47B (verified-unused WRAM gap). Room $6B's $D95E
  (shared with MedalMan original) also moved to $D478.
- ~~Room $6B NPCs blocked exit to Room $6C~~ → **Fixed (v25).** Egg giver
  at (3,3) and BGM changer at (1,4) removed; a prior session had moved
  them into positions that blocked the walkable path to the (3,1) exit
  without updating docs. Item giver at (2,2) retained.
- ~~dump_all_scripts.py decoded linearly, missing ~45% of WriteRAM ops
  at branch targets~~ → Fixed. Work-queue follows 9 branch opcodes.
  810/866 unique WriteRAM ops found (93.5%); 56 in alternate dispatch
  paths remain. $D9E3 story progression counter documented.
- ~~14 separate room-name dictionaries across tools (30–97 entries each,
  all different)~~ → Fixed. Created `dwm/map_names.py` as single source
  of truth (97 entries from editor/editor.py). All 14 tools now import
  from it. Regenerated JSONs use canonical names.
- ~~`analyze_event_flags.py` scanned scripts linearly, missing 70% of
  set_flag operations behind branches~~ → Fixed. Tool now reads
  `all_scripts.json` (branch-following data). Result: 298 flags with
  sets (was 92); check-only anomalies dropped from 219 to 29.
  `event_flags_complete.json` and `EVENT_FLAGS.md` regenerated.
  The 29 remaining are in the 6.5% unreached script paths or engine-set
  (flag $00F1 confirmed in unreached Castle script 0 branch at $0C:$46C4).
  Story progression fully mapped: arena-driven with mandatory Anger/
  Durran gate interludes.
- ~~Bank $04 inline comment at $59D2 labeled opcode $0E as
  "SetMapTransition"~~ → Fixed. $0E is **BranchByScreen** (branches
  if `wScreenIndex == param`). The real map transition is opcode
  **$0F** at $5A02 (MapTransitionFull: writes gate_id → $C96D, flag
  → $C96E, spawn XY, sets wIsPlayerChangingMaps). ROADMAP also
  corrected ($0E → $0F).
- ~~KEY_LESSONS claimed ROM palette pointers had "bit 15 set" as encoding
  marker~~ → **Corrected (Session 9).** Zero step-0 palette pointers have
  bit 15 set (verified all 107 entries). The actual issue: ROM palette bytes
  at `pal_ptr` are in an engine-internal format for ALL rooms, not just some.
  The game engine always transforms them at runtime. Editor tileset PNGs now
  use `room_palettes.json` (runtime-dumped data) via `regenerate_tileset_pngs.py`.
